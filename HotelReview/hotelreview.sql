In fact, its across the street from the waterfront, which is a popular place to go walking and sightseeing. We never rented a car or taxi; didnt need one. Granted, we walked about 3-5 miles a day, but stopped anywhere we wanted along the way. You dont need a car in the city, and you have to call for taxis anyway...why not walk?The room was always clean, and a decent size for the two of us. It had a weird smell though, but it wasnt something we couldnt tolerate, though. It is very charming and cozy, and is within a few yards of great restaurants and bars. In fact, out of all the meals we ate, the restaurant next door, Al Boccalinos, was the best. They provide room service for the hotel, and they have some of the best Italian food Ive ever had. Somewhat pricey, but it was SO good. Hotel staff were friendly, but not the most knowledgeable of all the questions I asked (such as, can they help with reservations for the Victoria Clipper, what bus # do we take to go to Ballard, etc.). But, they were very nice and always tried to help.The hotel was quiet when we were there, even though it seemed to be very crowded. I would recommend it to anyone.

The large room was beautifully decorated with the king size bed taking pride of place. It looked so peaceful and welcoming with the period furniture and matching appointments that I couldnt wait to unpack and relax with a cup of tea. The lighting was excellent with not a 40 watt bulb evident. The towels were plentiful and fluffy and there was loads of room in the bathroom to lay out my toiletries. I thought the framed picture on the wall was a nice homey touch. The room was quiet and there was no noise to disturb a dreamless sleep that night. In fact, I was glad the next morning I had set my alarm the night before.I enjoyed my Continental breakfast the next morning of toast, jam, yoghurt, fruit and coffee. There was also cold cereals, Danish and muffins on offer. I learned that bus transportation is free in the Pioneer Square area and the bus stop is just steps away from the hotel entrance on Yesler. However, since I wanted to explore on foot it was an easy walk to the Uwajimaya shopping complex in Chinatown - a delightful place.

The bed was comfy and there was a fridge and micro. The bathroom is on the smallish side but the water pressure was great. The room is completely green with low impact features which I would expect in Seattle.  The staff was very friendly, that famous northwest hospitality very evident. I would skip the restaurant in the lobby as it seems to be very basic hotel fare and since there are literally hundreds of great options so very close.

Really, tack on $20 to the price of the room and get rid of the charge, its silly.

They had a coffee maker with real coffee, a blow dryer, ironing board and cable TV. Local calls were free, which is very helpful when making reservations or just getting directions. I read in another review that the shuttle was a bust. But we had no problem with the shuttle, Actually it was a life saver. After walking all over seattle we really needed a ride. We called the shuttle and she was down and ready to go before we even got downstairs. The driver was great, we forgot something in our other hotel and she drove us over to pick it up. She nice and knowledgable of the area. We used the shuttle to drop us off at pike st. and called to be picked up at pioneer sq and she was there quick even durring rush hour. I highly recommend trying the shuttle.I did use the hottub and both times I went down it was empty and very peaceful. They also offer internet access on two computers in a somewhat private room, which was great to look up attraction pricing and hours. The location wasnt so bad overall. It was perfect for the space needle and all the attractions around it, it was only one parking lot away. It was a little farther away from the city center, but still a pleasant walking distance away. We had no issue on safety, we walked to a resturant in the Queen Anne neighborhood and back around 11pm and there were still familys, teenagers, and tourist of all kinds still out having fun.

I have read the other comments and have to agree with may things I read here. The lack of sound proofing is evident as I could hear the maids vacuuming the adjacent rooms. However I did not hear any of my neighbors - they were either quiet or the rooms were empty. I was on the 5th floor pretty far down the hall away from the elevator and they told me that this would be a quiet area which it proved to be. Another person in my group had the room from hell - evidently their neighbors were partying all night loudly and when the front desk was called the party would die down only long enough to pass inspection and them booted up as soon as the management left. I overheard comments about the restaurant food being overpriced, but I did not eat there. I did notice that the bar was closed up and deserted by 11 pm on a Saturday night despite the fact that our group was still using the adjacent room and many people wanted to wander over to the bar for a drink. The hotel is non-smoking except for a small area in the bar - this is a big plus for me. The location is extremely good if you are planning to go to the Seattle Center. They do accept pets - and welcomed my dog who was certainly pushing their 50lb limit - but they did charge a hefty one time $35.00 pet fee. I dont mind some kind of pet fee - but this seems a little high. While they have security measures in the garage at night - you have to use your room key to enter the gate - it is still a deserted garage and I dont think I would want to be caught down there waiting for the extremely slow elevator if someone snuck in behind me before the outside automatic gate closed. (During the day the gate was open all the time.) The neighborhood is industrial and there are some strange characters wandering around at night. For the most part if felt safe - if you paid attention while you walked around. I dont know about the shuttle - but I heard that a lot of people were waiting for it so you dont want to be in a rush when you use it. The room itself was clean and comfortable. Big pluses are the refrigerator (dorm room size with no mini-bar items using up the space) and the microwave as well as the WIFI connection. But be warned if you plan to leave your computer in your room - a member of our group was robbed of a couple thousand dollars worth of electronic gadgets when the thief slipped in when the maid was cleaning the room, acting as though they were the registered guest. There is a computer in their business office that you can use. The comments about the different attitudes of the staff was very true - some people were enthusiastic and helpful while others just wanted to quote me the corporate bible rules that supported them denying me an adjustment for the ridiculous pet fee. My rate was probably not the lowest rate as others have reported getting a better rate via expedia or price line. If you can get a bargain rate, and request a quiet room, this becomes an even greater value. It is easy in the daytime to walk everywhere if you like walking, and Seattle is a great town to see by foot. The parking for our group was free, and apparently it is free for all guests based on the other comments I have seen here, but you might want to check with the hotel.I did notice that they were using one outlet with an multi-plug adapter and did inform the management that a fire inspector would probably frown on this as a fire hazard.

The travel agent suggested I try this hotel as it is in the same zip code and was a three/four star property.On the location: Although this hotel is in the same zipcode as the convention center it is actually 1.1 miles north. The light rail public transportation system is still under construction (and thus was not a transporation option during my stay) and I didnt try to figure out the local bus system. I walked to and from the convention center during the day (it wasnt too hot) and I felt perfectly safe. I dont think I would walk the same route after dark though. The hotel does have a free shuttle to take you back and forth to the convention center if you like.Near the property: The hotel is in a fairly under-developed area of downtown Phoenix. Current maps of Phoenix show the hotel as being immediately adjacent to I-10 but those are misleading as the highway is underground in this part of the city (this meant there was less traffic noise and pollution than I expected). The hotel has a restaurant on the property (the Capital Grille) and there is a Fair-Trade coffee shop and Portlands Restaurant in the building next to the hotel. About 2 blocks further north is Cheuvronts Wine Bar. I ate at all three of these places during my time at the hotel and was happy with all three of them (note these restaurants are more fancy wine bar types of places than family friendly chain restaurants). My stay: I was given a room on the 3rd floor (I think it was 313)with 2 double beds and work area/desk. I thought the room was fairly spacious (ex it could have fit a rollaway bed into the work area without too much trouble). The housekeeping was fine, the cable tv worked, the bathroom was clean. The towels were thin and worn. My biggest issue with the room is that the air conditioning didnt work. No matter what temp I set the ac to, or how high I turned the fan, it blew warm air. I went down to the front desk to ask about it and was told that we havent switched over the a/c yet....this had a major impact on my comfort level during my stay. Fortunately the room has a window that you can open to allow for some air circulation otherwise I would not have been able to sleep comfortably. This room had a view over the outdoors pool. I did not use the pool or the exercise room so I cannot comment on these facilities.The hotel offers a complimentary breakfast each morning, served in the Capital Grille Restaurant. This consists of a selection of cold cereals and instant oatmeal, fruit, some pastries and make your own waffles, along with the standard tea and coffee. This hotel also offers free wireless. This worked just fine for me, acceptable speeds and no problems with signal strength.Overall it was an acceptable hotel for 2 nights but I wouldnt recommend it unless you need to stay there (for example the hotels near the convention center are full). It think it was a bit overpriced (my corporate rate was ~$150/night) and for that I would expect a better variety of foods at breakfast, better towels and working ac.Also, the hotel was full when I stayed and I noticed the front desk staff seemed a bit inexperienced. They were having problems with doubly occupied rooms (giving out room keys to new guests who were finding the rooms already occupied). They were also unsure how to handle my enquiries about the ac. They werent rude, just a bit unsure of what to say.So in summary a two/three star hotel, definately not four.

I would describe the experience as fair or average. Features I liked included the continental breakfast, efficient check-in, humble but useful work-out room, and an average room with a good bed. The free high-speed internet was great for email and small productions but slow for graphics-intensive work. It is still a great perk.Because we were on a business trip, I was very leery of giving my credit card for incidentals. Twice before at other places the front desk has billed my card instead of our purchase order. I spoke to two front desk clerks at check-in and check-out and both of them gave me the evil eye (in my opinion) when I brought this up. They were brief, bordering on rude, but they did ensure that the PO was billed appropriately. I could have done without the attitude. One of the desk clerks, a dark-haired woman with an eastern European accent was very nice to my coworker and knew all about the PO situation with our business. She deserves special recognition.The building appears to be on permanent lock-down, as the only way in is through the front door, away from the main parking area. I respect the need for more security, but what about card readers at the outside doors for guests?Some things future guests here should be aware of: there is construction all along Central Avenue right by the hotel and they are ripping up the road to build a light-rail. This is not the BWs fault, and of course I support the project but it makes it very difficult to actually find your way into the hotel. To get in, find your way to 3rd Ave, which is west of central ave. Then go north about two blocks to Portland street, turn right on Portland, then travel down a street of residential condos. go around the semi-circle at the end of Portland (next to Central) and look for the entrance for the hotel. Consult a street map before you go! At $222 for two nights, I would say that this BW is only a fair value for the price. I would not stay here again at this price on personal business.

Although we each, individually, paid our share of the room upon departure, they deducted the whole amount from my credit card (details of which had been taken upon reservation).

Although they did credit the excess charged, I ended up A$100 out of pocket because of the exchange rate. I wrote serveral letters about this shortfall, finally suggesting compensation on the grounds of illegally withdrawing more than I authorized, but all to no avail.

The other problem was the hotel manager - a young woman apparently somewhat new at her job. She tried to refuse my gold crown club points as payment for my stay.

Very nicely done. Only complaint would be that the view was the stairwell heading up to the second floor and several mattresses that were being stored(?) there.

But I think that is just downtown Phoenix.The good:My room was nice-- the beds were above average but not the super soft and fluffy ones you get in some hotels. I appreciated small adjustable reading lamps on both sides of both beds, and a cushioned window seat to look out at the view from. Free wired internet was nice, but it tended to come in and out, and was in fact down for about half a day while I was there. Bathrooms were nice and spacious with plenty of room to spread out toiletries and such. Slightly odd that there was a free standing closet in the sink area, but no matter. I at at the restaurant one night and it was surprisingly good for a hotel dinner. Starbucks in the lobby is closed on Sunday. Now the bad:Everyone was very nice and friendly when I checked in late at night. I got up to my room on the 16th floor, tired and ready for bed. Unfortunately, I noticed a small cockroach running around on the tile near the door. Yuck! I killed it, but called down and asked to change rooms-- this isnt my walk-up apartment in NYC after all. They were very gracious is changing my room quickly to another on the floor so I wouldnt have to come back down and added a credit for a drink at the bar to my account. Normally, I would just chalk this up to bad luck and not even mention it. However, on my last morning there in the new room, I saw and killed another one!

Like I said, having been a motel housekeeper myself - I do notice these things.I will be phoning the hotel - I had forgotten to give them all of the details - and from what I observed they do take interest in their patrons satisfaction. As with most of my trips - I dont get out much, and if there is no kitchenette I normally order room service. The quality of the food was OK, though my first night I had ordered pan fried noodles with chicken and shrimp, with a ginger sauce, and it was bone dry - even the noodles, with a rather bitter aftertaste. One sandwich dish stated it had a side of avocado - which consisted of pureed avocado - if you got it at all. I ordered this more than once, and though well cooked I only got the avocado once so the sandwich was bone dry. I even specifically asked for the side of avocado - still it wasnt delivered. For the price of room service I expect better. The servers were fine however, always very polite and professional. Not sure if the gift shop is a private enterprise, but the woman running the place was not the friendliest person Ive ever met - to put it lightly. First I had to call out to her to get her to come to the front desk - this was at 7:30 in the morning, but she had just served another customer. I had considered buying some souveniers for my young relatives back home, but changed my mind after dealing with this person. Otherwise, the hotel is relatively comfortable. The beds are adequate; I have a very bad back and slept fairly well so I consider them to be above average. The furniture was in good shape. The toiletries are above average.

Our vacation was actually set up to go on tours, not to stay in the downtown area which yes, it is VERY DEAD and small. We walked around on 3 seperate nights and all we spoke about was where are the bars and clubs and the people???..if you are looking to party..go elsewhere..Im not sure if Arizona is even a party place so just cancel your plans. If you are looking to go to the Grand Canyon and do other tours...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED..they work with Open Road Tours and if you book through the hotel, rates are cheaper. We did 4 different tours and they were all great..Arizona is beautiful...honestly, we had no idea how great it was. We felt confident that our tours were going to be worth every penny being that the Wyndham recommends them. Now, the room.....smaller than expected but it was amazingly comfortable.

We needed to print out a voucher for one of our tours and although we had our lap top, we did not have a printer..no worries..they have a computer room where you can use their computer, internet access and printer for FREEEEEEEEE...or you can connect your laptop and print away if you need to. Breakfast was really good...the buffet for $12 is all worth it. They have a Starbucks in the lobby....hair and nails salon in the lobby as well.

I was part of a convention contingent who had been booked into the hotel. The neighborhood is not good and if you do not have a car, you are captive to the hotel without other attractions, dining, etc within safe walking distance. The hotel seems to be about 5 miles from all attractions (down town, Scottsdale, etc) except the airport, which is very close by.The lobby was nice and comfortable and the front desk staff was pleasant. While my room was ready, others in my party waited hours for a room (and we arrived at about 3:30 PM).The official hotel photos looked nice, but the room photos they showed must have been somewhere else in the facility. The photos published by other reviewers were like my room. We had requested a double-double room for three adults. We had two beds, but they were small double beds, not the queens appearing in official photos and implied we would get. I ended up sleeping on the sleeper sofa so my wife and son could rest on a real bed. The sleeper sofa was like sleeping in a hammock without the comfort. It sagged terribly and the framework pressed very firmly across my chest a hips. It was a very uncomfrtable 7 nights. In addition, I discovered the bedding had not been changed prior to my use -- I ended up with insect bites all over my torso that I had initially attributed to a reaction to a laundry detergent.Room service arrived at our room around 5 PM every day except one while we were there. None of the maids spoke English. We had to call housekeeping to find someone who spoke English and ask that the bedding be changed on the sleeper sofa. Otherwise, the ladies did a good job when they finally got there.As written elsewhere, the rooms are severely in need of renovation (which is actually underway). The bathroom (tub and toilet) is very small. You almost have to climb over the toilet to get to the tub. Opening the door while you are in the bathroom is an adventure since the toilet does not allow much free space to move about. The sink is in the bedroom. It appears as the newly renovated rooms will have a more functional bathroom. Supplies were adequate. There is an iron and ironing board in the room, There is a hair dryer by the sink.Air conditioning was adequate, but ran nearly constantly and was a bit noisy. The small kitchen had a very high counter, but included a nice refrigerator, microwave and coffee maker.The TV was in need of replacement. Viewing selctions (the free ones) were pretty limited. There is a TV in the bedroom.Internet access was available either through an ethernet cable (located by the couch) or wireless. There is a $9.95 charge per 24 hours for use of the Internet (it amazes me that far less expensive properties offer this for free). The wireless connection dropped-off at times, making on-line work difficult at times.The pool was very nice. landscaping in the courtyard was enjoyable. There was a Gazebo with misters for outdoor functions.The on-site Agave Grill offered a wonderful free cooked-to-order breakfast every morning. Lunch selections were decent though a bit more expensive than I would like to spend. Dinner selections were expensive and mostly of a Southwest cuisine. You can order off the lunch menu. Other than breakfast, food taste and attractiveness was only fair. Every dinner plate I received was chipped (maybe I kept getting the same plate). The facility offers a Managers Happy Hour with free soda / pop and reduced price alcohol. There is also free finger food / snacks.There are laundry machines on-site, but be sure you have a supply of quarters -- they have none at the front desk and the bar only has a few.There is a new CVS Pharmacy across the street as well as Mexican grocery store -- otherwise, you need to walk some distance to find anything else...and this is not the best neighborhood. Taxis dont work this area...and if you catch a cab down town, have the hotel address in hand since most cab drivers do not seem to know where this place is located. i could not figure out the Metro bus system, but doubt I would have used it anyway in this area.

In terms of what I would expect from the Embassy Suites brand, this was mediocre to disappointing. The property itself is in a marginal/transitional part of the city, and is not particularly convenient to many of the major attractions in the Phoenix area. A traveler staying here would definitely need a car to get around. It is an older facility, though would have much promise with a major upgrade. The rooms are relatively spacious, but a bit spartan and worn. The entry doors were marginally secure. The walls were thin, so any external noise from outside or in adjacent rooms were sometimes quite audible. Some of the electrical outlets worked part of the time, or not at all. The air conditioning was spotty at times. The in-room refrigerator was slow in chilling stored beverages or food items. The bathroom is incredibly small; you very nearly had to step over the toilet to get into the shower/bathtub. The beds were small and rock-hard, which - combined with the spotty air conditioning - could make restful sleep problematic. The televisions were old and in poor working order, and the cable system was even worse, as several featured channels were nothing but snow depending on the time of day, or even the room you were watching in.General cleanliness of the facilities was so-so. Housekeeping was open to the outside, and cleaned bath towels were stacked near the entry, which almost made laundry pointless. Laundry facilities were also outside; while the washer and dryer units were relatively clean, there was no place to fold or stack. Additionally, quarters were virtually a precious commodity in the hotel, and $1.00 only bought you 20 minutes of drying time. Housekeeping services were ridiculously slow and late-arriving. It was not uncommon during the weeks stay that your room would be left unserviced until as late as 4:30pm. On average, housekeeping would not arrive until about 3:30pm. My two or three experiences with the front desk staff were generally poor; they did not seem knowledgable about their own property or the area, and could not meet my requests (see above with obtaining quarters for laundry).The saving grace to this property was the Agave Cafe, their on-site restaurant and bar. The staff was very polite, friendly, and responsive - even in busier periods - and the food selection was very good and generous in portion size. Lunch and dinner prices were as to be expected for hotels. Again, this property was not what I expected from what I knew fo the Embassy Suites brand. This property was undergoing a renovation during my stay, which appeared to include a complete rebuild of the guest suites. If they do an extensive renovation, there is some promise to the property, but they will have much work ahead of them to make it a place I could recommend to other travelers.

The front desk was very pleasant and check in no problem but the room was clearly in need of a renovation. All rooms are exterior corridor opening to their courtyard. The interior wall adjacent to the corridor is painted brick and doesnt give a great feel rather it feels like a cheap attempt to hide odd construction. The furnishings were old, wallpaper worn, bathroom needed cleaning and sprucing up etc etc. The location is not, I am now advised, in a very secure part of town.The internet connection ($9.95 per day) is via a ethernet cable which never worked during my two night stay. Luckily, the business center in the lobby was open and working.The hotel has a restaurant on its fifth floor which served decent food.Overall, I was disappointed with the quality of the room and would not return to this property.

A few fans were given out but the only window in our suite faced the busy street on the ground floor and had no screen. We requested a room change but were told none were available. Repeated complaints to the front desk resulted in several free meals at the restaurant- which actually was very good and, oddly, airconditioned unlike the rooms. Nothing was done about the room temperature or the screens or the fan which fell out of the open window.A month after our stay there was an expose on Good Morning America of the cleaning practices at this hotel. They showed cleaning staff wiping floors with used towels and then using the same towels to clean drinking glasses. It wasnt that surprising after our stay.

I was a little nervous, but I had never stayed at a bad embassy. The web site doesnt mention this but 80% of the rooms are outside with front and back entrances leading to the outside. On this particular day it was 110 degrees in Phoenix. When we arrived we were hot. We had driven for two twelve hour days in the sun, and just wanted to relax. We checked in, front desk staff courteous. Gave us our room key and we went on our way. First thing we noticed upon walking in the room was the smell. It was very musty and the room was a COMFORTABLE 87 degrees. The air was completely off. So we turned it down and waited for it to cool off. Not so lucky. After two hours the room was only down to 77 degrees and it wasnt going any lower. I am on medication and am supposed to watch my heat exposure and I was already way too hot. Then I saw a sign that said you have to pay for internet and local calls. Also not on their website. Called the front desk to complain...then went to the front desk to inform them about the air. They said they would send maintenance and I was a gold member so the internet was free. 30 more minutes pass. I make another call. Oh they havent been there yet? He probably doesnt have his radio. Ill look for him. Can I speak to a manager? Oh theres not one on the property. As I am standing over a letter that says if you dont rate us a ten call the manager on duty. We will find someone and give you a call. Ok...twenty more minutes pass now I am calling the 1-800 hilton number. Oh and by the way the internet is down. Or isnt strong enough to reach your room. Temperature is still 76 degrees. Finally an hour after the first call maintenance shows up. Meanwhile hilton honors is trying to get me in another hotel. When hilton finally reaches the manager she says if they leave they still have to pay. By the way this was also after asking to switch rooms. We were told there were no other available rooms. Finally three hours after checking in we were released to go somewhere else. We ended up in a beautiful hotel, for twenty more dollars a night. I do not believe our problem would have been resolved so QUICKLY if we had not been Hilton honors gold members. By the way maintenance took the cover off the air conditioner, took it apart and put it back together again and said it was fixed. Temperature upon checking out 76 degrees. Stay away if you can.

The pool was about 100 degrees and offered no respite from the 115 degree heat. The rooms are definately dated and the location is in a less than optimal neighborhood. The breakfast wasnt bad, but Ive had better at other Embassy Suites. When I returned one week later at 2:00 on a Saturday afternoon I called for a pickup. I was told that no shuttle was available so I should to take a cab to the hotel and they would reimburse the driver $16. When the cab driver asked to be paid, they refused to pay him and I was stuck with the bill! They said they had no record of my stay, so I asked the manager, Tamara Carter, if she wanted to see my receipt. She did, so I dug through my luggage and produced a receipt for my $142 stay. She then said that I had neglected to sign in when I arrived the week before, so she couldnt reimburse me for the cab ride. She pointed out that if I had parked at the airport, it would have cost me a lot more than $16. I pointed out that I wouldnt have stayed at their hotel had I known they were going to charge me for the transportation. This hotel administration is obviously trying to cut expenses by not paying for a shuttle and sticking it to the hotel guests.

After the second day, you start to get used it, but it defintely smells old. The hotel room was not very pleasent. The carpet had several noticable stains around the room. The ceiling had two buldged areas that looked like they could come down soon. The room also smelled old and musty. The room floor was slanted.

Since I was only there for two nights, I ended up putting the do-not-disturb sign out the entire time (no need for housekeeping to come in if theyre not going to change my sheets or towels.)Two things made the entire stay a 3 star instead of a 2 star.

The restaurant staff and front desk staff were really friendly and suggested great places in the city to visit and eat.

We still had to play it smart with our money until her new job started, so an in-town vacation was in order.I surprised her by taking her to one of the nicer hotels in one the nicer hotel chains in townéˆ¥îšºhe Hyatt Regency.

It was also the first hotel Iéˆ¥æªe stayed in where the bathroom had toothpaste too, amazing how little things start to count. The bed was huge and covered with comfy pillows.

Tonight, a group of 13 of us got together for dinner at a local restaurant. We asked the bellman for cabs. Limousines arrived. Some in our party specifically asked why we had limousines instead of cabs. The bellman told us these were cabs. A couple of us who had been out around the town already remarked that we had not seen cabs in the city, and we thought maybe this was another of the weird surreal things about this very weird surreal city. In hindsight, we should have been more wary. We were being screwed. Of course these werent cabs. There was no meter, just an announcement of a charge at the end of the trip. The limos cost a total of $95 plus tips to take us about 5 miles. At the end of our meal, we asked for cabs, and got...cabs! Total fare: $39 plus tips. We confronted the bellman, who first said we had asked for limos. We were clear that we had not. Then he said he was using our regular car service, but said that we had been overcharged. We protested that the problem wasnt just that we had been overcharged, but that in fact we had gotten what we did not ask for and that we were not dealt with honestly. He told us we were free to talk to the manager. We did so. The manager apologized, but when I asked him directly what the hotels policy was on calling limos when guests asked for cabs, he denied that this was their practice. However, in discussing the issue with other conference attendees, it seems that consistently guests who ask for cabs are being ushered into limos, and then stuck with bills at the end of the trip. I have seen the limo/cab scam elsewhere. its not unique to this hotel. I wouldnt be surprised if theres a kickback involved. But guests have a right to be treated fairly, not be hustled into scams, and to be able to trust our hosts. The Phoenix Hyatt failed on all counts. I wont be coming back. If you must stay here and need a cab rather than a limo, be sure to be explicit with the bellman, and dont get into a car without a meter unless you negotiate on price up front.

I was in the area for business meetings and a trade conference.The property is convenient to major highways and Sky Harbor Airport but is in a downtown area that has very little to offer. The entire area is quiet. Few people are seen on the street, except the occasional homeless person who approaches travelers for a dollar. Hotel security works to keep them away from the property, with mixed results.Please do not plan to do much downtown. If a sports team is not playing, you will be leaving downtown to do anything. A light rail system is being installed. Perhaps this will increase local visits and downtown activities. The entire area is in serious need of shopping, eateries and activities.The property exterior and lobby areas are clean and functional with most business related needs easily met. It features a UPS Store in the lobby with rapid access to shipping, fax and mailing services. A small gift shop with essential toiletries and an Einstein Bagels are also in the lobby.Check-in at the Hyatt was flawless. The staff was polite and helpful, even though I had a complicated payment system that affected not only me, but fifteen other people from my company who were arriving later than I. As previously noted in another review, upstairs hallways leading to guest rooms are in need of additional lighting. It was a dark area to navigate from the time one left the elevators.I was sold a king room and requested an upgrade to a King Business Room due to my length of stay. This was denied due to high hotel occupancy.The room was spotless, fairly spacious and was maintained extremely well. The bed was comfortable and the bedding was obviously new. The bathroom is small and did not fetaure drawers for storage of essentials. This is an issue when ones stay is long. Plenty of towels and tolietries were available and refreshed daily and on request.Many reviewers have commented on room temperature and this is indeed a serious issue for this property. There is no doubt; the system is regulated by a house-wide computer system that regulates guest input into temperature control. The standard temperature is 73 - 74 degrees. Guests can turn the system down and the temperature drops. But in 15 minutes it automatically reverts back to the higher temperature. This is simply unacceptable in a property like this. While working one entire day in the room I had to constantly visit the electronic thermostat to make adjustments. The alternative is to leave the drapes completely closed all of the time. This is also unacceptable. I realize that hotels must control costs, but in the middle of the desert, Hyatt administartors must find a way other than room temeprature.I needed a light bulb replaced on day four of my stay. I phoned maintenance and a service technician was in the room within five minutes. While there we discussed the temperature issue. He indicated that there must be problem with the system since I should be able to make any adjustment and have it stay there. I didnt believe it then and I dont believe it now. Too many reviewers have had the same problem. He indicated he would check on it and get back to me. Im still waiting.Food at the property was up to Hyatt standards and service was prompt and polite. The prices were typical yet pricey. The value for the food was lower than I would like. Room service was excellent, breakfast served at the requested time and late night snacks arriving in a flash and were presented very well.This is a nice property with just a few sticky issues. Its proximity to the Convention Center makes it the preferred property for those attending trade shows. Its proximity to sports facilities would make it convenient for travelers as well. A correction of the items I mentioned and a general upturn in available activities and dining downtown would help significantly.

He recommmended an Italian restaurant (we have forgotten the name, for reasons detailed below) located about ten minutes away by car. The food was very poor. The service was good. The facility had not been renovated since the 1970s. The recommendation was so poor that it made us wonder about the motivations of this hotel representative to recommend this place -- did he really dislike us that much, or did he have a personal interest in our visit?We had breakfast at the hotel one morning. The food was poor, in taste, quality and presentation. The service was okay. The buffet -- an option we did not select -- looked like the food items had been recycled recently. It was expensive, though.A bar is located in the lobby. It yields lots of cigarette smoke that invades and lingers in other sections of the lobby area.The facility is located in the heart of downtown Phoenix.Overall, this hotel is okay. It is not charming or elegant. It is not staffed by a motivated or engaged team of workers. We rate it merely as a place to bunk for a night or two. In summary, this facility is not at this time well positioned to compete for your discretinary personal or business travel dollars. In our view, this hotel experienced better days years ago. We do not plan to return.

We were able to check-in early, and arrived to a nice clean room. However, the television was in a cabinet at a 90 degree angle to the bed. You could pull the TV out on a sliding shelf  turn it towards the bed, however, it didnéˆ¥æª› pull out far enough so the cabinet obscured about a quarter of the TV. In order to watch the TV properly, you either had to lie on the right hand side of the bed (no good if there are 2 of you) or you would have to sit in the corner chair. Also, the coffee maker was in the bathroom, which I found rather unsanitary and inconvenient. Perhaps worst of all, the room had no internet access. I wanted to check in for my Sunday flight on Saturday evening and inquired at reception about internet access within the hotel. The clerk told me that they had internet access in the UPS Store, but it was closed, and closed on Sunday. I cant believe a hotel the caliber of Hyatt doesnt offer in-room internet access, or at least a business center. I had to ask her where the nearest internet cafèŒ… was, as she did not offer the information.Perhaps the worst aspect of the Hyatt experience was the Sports Grill/Bar downstairs. We went to get lunch the day we checked in, and it wasnt busy. A server said she would be with us in a minute. She never came back, so after 20 minutes, we left and went across the street. The next evening we went back down to the bar to have a drink. It was very busy and only one server for almost the entire bar. People were getting up and leaving after not being even acknowledged, let alone have their drink orders taken. Finally, when he came up to our table, I asked him what beers he had on draft. Instead of simply answering me, he grabbed the menu, opened it to the page listing beers, saying nothing. Not only did I find that very rude, he was almost 30 minutes getting our order to us. Meanwhile, more people are leaving than are coming into the place. We wouldve left and gone across the street, but there was a power outage affecting all the restaurants near the hotel.During our stay, we ate at a two restaurants across the street and were greeted promptly and courteously. Both the food and the service were very good and well beyond the Hyatt. For a major hotel in the heart of downtown Phoenix, serving not only guests but locals, the Hyatt Regency leaves much to be desired.

We were tired.We went swimming later in the pool. No one was out there except one other guest. It was nice. Then we checked out. It took quite a long time being that there was only one desk clerk and two people in front of me. The clerk was very professional and good.

Some hotels are a little snippy if you snag a great deal, but the Radisson staff were exceptionally gracious. My room on the 5th of 6 floors was spacious, clean, and lovely beyond expectations. The bathroom was quite large by most hotel standards  the shower had one of those cool curved shower rods that gives a few extra inches of space. Never used one before but I immediately went home and bought two for my house.The mattresses had all been recently upgraded to the Comfort Select Sleep Number Bed. Never used one before either, didnt buy one but it was quite comfortable and fun to play with. Used room service  the delivery was speedy, food hot  a decent value. I was impressed with the range of selection in the menu. Prices are high, but typical for this tier of hotel.As mentioned, not a lot within walking distance. Free parking, free 24 hour business center with two PCs and a printer, 24 hour sundry shop attached to the reception desk, nice seating area by the lobby for quiet conversations, black-out drapes in the rooms and a floor layout that minimizes walk-by traffic headed towards the elevator.I did share my room with a cricket, but this was true of 3 out of 4 hotels I used during my trip. Maybe its just an added good luck feature or perhaps I traveled during the wrong time of the year. The floor to ceiling, lined drapes  sheers make locating the critters a challenge that just isnt worth it at 3:30 am.Id definitely try to stay at this location again.

Is there anything youd like to share with us? Trip began by being picked up by the Hotel Shuttle. The shuttle driver was very courteous and explained that the shuttle would be available to take us to either the Airport, Shopping Mall or the University area for alternative area to eat. If we needed the shuttle in the morning, he recommended that we reserve the hotel shuttle the night before.Check-in was very easy, however I was disappointed in the decor of the lobby - very dark, old and outdated.Upon entering the room, I immediately noticed a strong musty odor. The room looked like it had only a cursery cleaning from when the last guest checked out. The bathroom floor was SO FILTHY we had to lay towels down on it to cover it up. The carpeting next to the bed (adjacent to the wall) was wet. No room service menu or any other information about the hotel in the room.We decided to grab the shuttle to the Mall to have lunch - however, the front desk advised no shuttle for 3 hours due to a change in shift of drivers. Disappointed, we were forced to eat in the hotel bar...again, very dingy, dark atmosphere - looked like something out of a 70s porno.The following day, the carpet was still wet - room smelled like skunks had slept in it. I had reserved the shuttle at 5:00AM to the airport where I was to have business meetings all day. Upon arriving at the front desk at 4:53AM, the clerk informed me the shuttle had already departed and would not run again for 30 minutes. I had to call a TAXI and barely made it to the airport for my first meeting at 5:30AM. This was one of the reasons I chose the Radisson based upon the early morning time when I would require shuttle service. While I was at my business meeting, I called front desk to advise I would either need to change rooms or would have to check out. The front desk clerk advised she would hold a different room for me, to check with her when I returned that evening.Upon returning, no room was held, but they said they would look for an alternative. In the meantime, the room adjacent to mine was being serviced by maintenance (a leak was discovered, hence the wet carpeting). After two hours of continuous banging noises from the service next door, I called the front desk again stating that I was checking out. At this point, the front desk clerk discovered he had an alternative room for me. I changed rooms - no offer of assistance moving luggage was henceforth.The next morning, much to my surprise my bill included approximately $60 worth of Local Phone Call charges for the Internet useage. I travel on business almost weekly - never have I been charged so much for local phone calls.I checked the room for a Notice to guests regarding the hotel phone policy. There was none. I brought it to the attention of the front desk, he replied We are in the process of making up new flyers for the rooms After much discussion, he reduced the amount of the phone calls to .75 each - still an inconvenience to someone traveling on business where many hotels now offer high speed internet service in the room AND free local calls.I found this property very dirty, deceptive about the phone call policies and shuttle service unreliable. I would not recommend this property to anyone traveling on business. This was my first stay at a Radisson property and will most likely be the last.

All I can say to sum it up is WOW. Once you pull up into the courtyard, you feel like you are transported into another world. Aside from the immaculate service and lush, impeccable grounds, the vibe is the ultimate in laid-back luxury. Trust me, you will not have to lift a finger while you are there. We went into Old Town Scottsdale once and came to the conclusion that there was really no point in leaving our perfect oasis! The resort is perfect for a romantic getaway (next time we are going with our husbands, and trust me, there will be a next time!), but if you go with a friend youll feel right at home too.

It is like having your own little villa with a small patio overlooking the lime trees and Camelback mountain. We never head another person walk by our room or any other noises during the day.

The grounds were beautiful- well maintained and had a tropical feel. The pool is small- not great for laps, but wonderful for floating. I think the smallish number of chairs might be a problem when the hotel is fuller than it probably was when we were there. The umbrellas are huge and offered a lot of shade, but if you wanted sun you could have it (do you want to sit in the sun in 105 degree heat?). We stayed in room 138, which had the worlds most comfortable bed, a nice sitting area, a flat-screen television with standard cable, a private area outside and a newly redone bathroom. Housekeeping kept the rooms spotless. We enjoyed turndown service every night and looked forward to cards and candies we would find. The restaurant is good, but expensive. You can eat at the lounge, where entrees range in price from about $14 to about $40. If you do, definitely try the tempura asparagus- it was a highlight! There is a $22 daily gratuity fee attached to your nightly stay, and it is totally worth it. I cannot stress enough how attentive the staff is. When we called for our car, the men actually ran to get it to us faster.

I love the Royal Palms. The whole property is beautiful, the resort is small enough to feel intimate, and the service is always amazing.I like the Montevista Terrace rooms, which have a patio or balcony overlooking a central courtyard with a decorative pool and pretty sitting areas set around firepits. The rooms are a decent size and beautifully decorated with particularly nice bathrooms which have deep oval soaking tubs and separate shower cubicles. There is even a window (no glass, just an opening with shutters to close if you want privacy) cut into the wall between the bedroom and the bathroom which is a nice touch. The Estate rooms are basically the same, and in the same building, but dont have a patio or balcony and lack the view.The only downside is the smallish pool area. The pool is beautiful, the sunloungers very comfortable and the service great, but the pool area and the pool itself are quite small and so both can feel crowded and noisy if the hotel is busy. Luckily its not a very child-friendly hotel so it tends to be groups of adults only, but even then it can get a bit frenetic and noisy at the pool which you might find annoying if youre looking for peace and quiet.

Heres where things started to get real good. Traveling in the off-season, I thought Id secured a pretty good deal - I believe it was $150/night for one of their basic rooms. Well, without even asking, I was upgraded to one of the new Spa Suite rooms. When the bellboy took me to my room, and opened the door, I almost fainted. It was stunning! On entering the room, the sounds of soothing, acoustic music enveloped you. The lighting was just right, dim, and romantic.

In the center of the room was the most luxurious bath Ive ever had the privilege of looking at, let alone, using! Deep, soaking tub, those bowl sinks that sit on top of the the vanity. A walk-in steam shower, lotions, shower gels, shampoo and conditioners that were heavenly! You then enter the bedroom, and it was the most comfortable bed Ive ever slept on. Just gorgeous. Dark stained wood floors. Two plasma tvs (one in the sitting area, another in the bedroom). And to top it off, a beautiful balcony that looked over a stunning courtyard area. One afternoon we were serenaded by a spanish guitartist. Pinch me - I must be dreaming!! Unfortunately, it was so daggone hot, I couldnt really take advantage of the balcony. Also, because I was running around a bit for wedding activities, a long day trip to the Grand Canyon and The Police concert the Monday before I left, I really didnt get to enjoy the room for my 4 night stay as much as I would have liked. But that just gives me an excuse to make a return trip - during a better -cooler - time of the year.Oh - and service. Talk about going the extra mile. I discovered that my credit card was missing from my purse. I couldnt find it anywhere. I wasnt sure if Id dropped it while shopping or possibly in the car. Well, one of the valets did a painstaking search throughout my rental car and managed to find the card in a really obscure location. I guess it had fallen out of my purse while I was driving. I was so grateful for the time and effort this gentleman put into finding the lost item. Overall, service was exemplary throughout my stay.Royal Palms has spoiled me for life when it comes to hotel accomodations. I doubt there is a place that will ever measure up to my experience last summer. The surprise factor alone of getting such a beautiful room at a fraction of its normal nightly rate is something Ill likely never experience again. In a nutshell, Royal Palms is simply amazing!!

Weve been to Royal Palms Resort 3 times now and I cant imagine staying anywhere else in the Phoenix area. I was there once with my daughter for her college spring break for the Ladies Fling, once with my husband for our anniversary and once as a family. This resort was great for all of these vacations. It is small which is a refreshing change from staying at huge hotels. It was pricey, but worth saving up for. We were treated like royalty. I liked the resort fee concept which relieved us of having to worry about tipping the staff. Everyone working there seemed to truely enjoy their jobs. The rooms were luxurous in a tasteful comfortable way and we could enjoy our mornings and evenings on the patio right outside our room. The grounds and pool were gorgeous. If I had to find something that wasnt perfect it would be that they were short of pool chairs during peek swimming times, and some guests would stake them out for the entire day. However when we were at the pool we felt like we were really on vacation sipping our drinks delivered to us poolside. The spa was awesome and dining at the restaurant was truely a gourmet experience.

The plumbing wasnt great, and there were ants in the sink! (not a big deal, but they were there!).

My husband and I just stayed at the Royal Palms Hotel to celebrate our 4th wedding anniversary. Although the grounds are very beautiful, the rooms are romantic, and T. Cooks Restaurant and Lounge, and the service by the pool are all extraordinary, the business end of the hotel leaves QUITE A BIT TO BE DESIRED!When we arrived, our room was not ready and the person at the check-in desk said he would call within the hour to let us know what the status of our check in would be. When we had not received a phone call more than two hours later, we stopped by the front desk. The person did not seem to remember us, but another person at the desk asked if our phone number was on file and said that she would call. The second Royal Palms representative did call, and we ended up checking in about 3:30 pm (which is a 1/2 hour before the scheduled check-in time --even though I sent a request asking about an early check-in since I knew that we would be arriving around 10 am). Although we understand that our room was not ready early, I would have appreciated the call that the first representative said that he was going to make so that we could have made a better use of our afternoon. I was surprised that the room did not have a fireplace. I had called the property to inquire about fireplaces in the Deluxe Casitas (where we were booked), and was told that those rooms did have fireplaces; yet, we were placed in a room without one. The room was cozy, but I was looking forward to this particular amenity. On the second night of our stay, we had to call housekeeping to receive turn down service and request to have our towels changed. My biggest problem with the Royal Palms was the check-out/billing procedure. First, my minor issue. I had asked for our boarding passes to be printed (since that is a service that the Royal Palms offers), but the person at the front desk did not remember to give them to me until I asked. OK, a little oversight, but coupled with what followed, it just made the little oversight magnified.My major issue has to do with billing. First we were given the wrong bill (with someone who was charged about half what we paid per night for lodging). Then we were given our bill with three nights charges for Rose Petal Turndown Service when we only had that service the first night. The Royal Palms check-out representative then deducted the subsequent two nights and informed us that we would receive an updated e-mail version of our bill before we were charged. I did not receive the e-mail version of the bill, but my credit card was charged for the total of the invoice I received upon departure and an additional amount. After calling the resort several times to speak with someone in accounting, I left a message asking someone to send me an updated (and corrected invoice with an explanation of any additional charges). When I received the e-mail with an updated copy of my bill there was ANOTHER FRAUDULENT CHARGE! I spoke with someone after receiving that invoice and she seemed a bit annoyed with my inquiries and requests to have the charges explained and removed.Finally, there were so many events being hosted at the Royal Palms (at least one every day of our visit), that the staff often seemed pulled away from their lodging guests. It seemed that during our stay there was not sufficient staff to address the needs of ALL guests, those lodging at the property and those hosting special events.For a property of this size, requesting what the Royal Palms requests per night for lodging, service should be seamless and all guests should feel like they are VERY special. We are not picky guests, if it were not for the abovementioned snafus, we would have never interacted with the Royal Palms staff since I had arranged all of our activities and dining options prior to arrival. In the event that the service is not seamless and the guests are not made to feel extra special, the property management should follow-up with guests to the best of their ability to explain the situation and offer some sort of compensation. I have traveled extensively for business and pleasure, and have stayed in large and small hotels where the management generally seemed to be concerned with the well-being of the guests. I did not feel that this was the approach at the Royal Palms Hotel.

I was finishing up a long and difficult week of traveling to several cities and thought doing my last day of business in a spa and resort would help chill me out. But, this place is for romance, for couples, for people who want to veg out at the spa and try to take themselves to another level. All I wanted was a computer connection that worked, to be left alone to write and lot of hot coffee. Not exactly a match made in heaven. Truthfully, I felt like I was living in an alternative universe where everyone just smiled and nodded and repeatedly asked me if I was having a fabulous time. W/hen my room wasnt ready and I had to wait 2 hours, the nice lady at the front desk suggested I get a hot stone message while I waited -- it would clear me out and help my writing. Then once I got into my room and was just falling into a nap during the only 2 hours I had to rest in my room before finishing up my business, someone knocked on my door, woke me up and offered me tea. Okay, so you get it. This place is gorgeous, the grounds manicured to within an inch of their life. The rooms are exceedingly comfortable and meant totally for romance. And, if this is you, please do come because youll probably give it 5 stars like the many given in the past.

Nice quality mattresses, linens, and amenities. The service is comparable to the Beverly Hills Hotel. An example is: we asked about a restaurant and they brought reviews to us; and when we decided to dine there, they made reservations and printed a map. Everything was waiting in an envelope when we went to get our car for the evening. We are treated so well, weather we are in a smaller summer discount room or a suite in March for spring training. The employees of The Royal Palms Inn will go out of there way to assist you to the best of their ability, we did not hear éˆ¥æ¸˜oéˆ¥?with out a very valid reason; and they came up with alternatives.

As many satisfied guests have noted, the property is initimate, well-groomed, historic, romantic (part of its schtick is to promote romance), and an utterly refreshing change from the mega resorts like the Biltmore and Phoenician which are nearby on Camelback. These are high points, along with the good service and friendly staff. However, we thought it didnt quite live up to our expectations. And, frankly, Im a bit surprised at the surfeit of 5s in the tripadvisor ratings. The Royal Palms is good...but that good? We had a designer casita room which we thought was a bit dark and maybe a bit too in-your-face with a romantic furnishing (to be fair, this is the theme of the place). The bathtub in our room was mundane. Just a tub. But it had a huge walk in shower (with only one head). Far better, we thought, if the tub were a two-person jacuzzi tub and the shower more routine (to stick with the romance theme). The room had two patios, but the back patio was small, the walls were high, there was no planting or other vegetation. It was quite claustophobic. And the larger front patio -- where we did sit and eat breakfast one morning -- was not especially private. People could walk right by, within feet of our table (there were curtains we could pull across...but that just made it less scenic). Our room also was noisy. The AC was noisy, but most of all there was a constant running of water, like a toilet or shower was running next door. Maybe it was unique to this room -- Room 105 -- because we were at the end of a row of casitas and near the kitchen (could it have been kitchen plumbing?). Overall, the room seemed very nice and pretty but not luxurious by any means. Incidentally, these designer casitas are on the west side of the property and a bit isolated from the other rooms and casitas. You should ask to be on the east side -- youll be closer to the pool and spa too. Finally, to our minds, one drawback was the lack of public rooms. Yes, I know, this is a boutique kind of establishment and I guess the expectation is that guests will walk the grounds or hole up in their rooms, but a couple of indoor public spaces would have been nice. The lobby here is not big -- just a check-in area. And when its 110 outside, the outside sitting areas are not always comfortable.Call me a nitpicker, but it wasnt a perfect 5, at least if judged against other properties that try to reach the same customer base and at the same price range. But I have no problem recommending it as a sweet alternative to the big resorts -- especially if you are looking for a special romantic kind of getaway.

I booked back in June for a Montevista Terrace Suite. When we arrived we were taken to our room. Seemed like the last room on their lot. We were told they chose this for us due to extra privacy. When I walked in I knew right away it wasnt what I had requested. I asked what was going on and our bellman (Chris) contacted the front desk. Turns out they overbooked so they gave us a higher end room. My wife and I rarely complain but in this situation I was upset that they didnt tell me this up front. I looked out our lone window and saw a fence and whatever business is next door and their vehicles. Could not see CamelBack. Spent 1 hour trying to get the front desk to cooperate and they eventually moved us to a designer casita. Very nice. Still not what I originally requested but a very nice place. Later that evening there was a knock at our door and a food and beverage gentleman came in w/ a tray of truffles. There were 3 plates and 3 cards on this tray. He left 1 card and plate w/ us. It was an apology. You would expect a place like this to at least hide the fact that they have made several mistakes, seemed too routine. Maybe the last stop he made was the most genuine. I dont want to bash Royal Palms as it was a very impressive place as was the everyday service. As everyone else has stated, Rick, Jose, and Kevin are solid down by the pool.

We actually changed our holiday plans and went back for 3 more nights!!! We were moving on to Sedona next then Bryce canyon then ending up in Las Vegas. So after 2 nights in Boston The Royal Palms was our next stop. This hotel is perfect if you really want to chill out. The bell boys park your car for you and when you need it all you need to do is call them and its waiting outside the main door with the air con already on!! All the staff were fantastic here, but have to mention the guys at the Cabana Pool Bar! We had iced water that was constantly being topped up, cold flannels given to us to keep us cool! We were really well looked after. (Could so get used to that lifestyle!!!) The Hotel grounds are beautiful and all the small villas are set amongst the gardens. We stayed in one of the villas when we returned and they are great, although we did prefer our first room which was a Montivista Terrace room. They are the newest rooms in the resort and are fitted out beautifully, gorgeous sunken bath and THE most comfiest bed i have ever slept in!!! T Cooks the restaurant on the resort is fantastic! Have to reccomend the Pork Belly! Gorgeous! We will definatley be returning to the Royal Palms again one day. Just wish it was today!!!Alaina  Wes. Manchester UK.

Upon arrival, everyone greeted me and my fiance and was very nice to us. We were checked in quickly and lead to our room which was part of their Montavista Collection. After looking at their website just now, Im not sure if that was the room I was booked in so Ill have to contact them about that. The casita I stayed in was beautiful. The bed was nice and comfortable, even though my fiance complained of bedbugs, I think they were insect bites from us laying out on the hammocks or sitting outside on the patio area of our room. The pool area is small but there only a few people out there when we visited the bar area that services the pool. The staff at the bar were polite and chit chatted with us about the city and its surroundings. I did not eat at T. Cooks because reservations were needed but I did order room service which was okay. They could offer a better variety of food but again, no complaints. I did not visit the spa either, and probably wouldnt no matter how long my stay was. It is severly overpriced. I would visit again and recommend this resort over a lot of the other resorts in Phoenix because its more intimate, better for couples or honeymooners.

It wasnt, it was absolutely perfect from the staff to the room to the grounds you could not ask for more.You could wander around the grounds without even seeing anybodyelse and it was more like being a guest in a beautiful spanish home than a hotel. Pool was busy as it was a holiday w/end but poolstaff super attentive, 5 star service.The only gripe we had was the transportation. The first night we ordered a taxi and a limo pullled up, we thought it was complimentary-nice. It wasnt . Although a little more expensive than a taxi (depending on the driver) we felt a bit ripped off.Turns out we couldnt get a taxi from the hotel without waiting almost 30-40 mins so we had to use the limo service (who were always at the hotel and always charged a diferent price) for the w/end. So, if you dont have a car use Discount Taxi and just call at least half hour before as the taxis are not allowed to wait at the hotel.We ate at T.Cooks hotel restaurant food not bad, not great atmosphere-wonderful!Also, loved the in room kettle and cafetiere, never seen this in a hotel and what a difference a nice cuppa makes before you get out of bed.

We went to the spa and had massages and pedicures, did Yoga and Pilates, enjoyed T. Cooks restaurant one night , room service, and just enjoyed the gardens, fountains and general atmosphere of the hotel. One day we didnt even bother to leave the hotel all day. Cant wait to go back! The only issue we had was we had booked a room through Expedia and requested 2 double beds. When we arrived we were told they had no more rooms with 2 double beds and were given a king suite with one bed and a pull out couch in the living room. Well, neither of us wanted to pay $300 per night to sleep on a pull out couch (and thats a bargain compared to their normal prices!) so we made do with the king size bed. They had told us the first night that we could move to a different room with 2 beds the next day. When we went to the office the next morning we were told by some different people that there were no rooms available that day and we could move the next day. Well, that was half way through our trip and it was getting rather annoying. The girl at the front desk did not seem to be too accommodating and said that was the best she could do. I asked to speak to the Manager and she informed me she was the Manager. Anyway, by that afternoon she did come through for us and upgraded us to a Spa Suite (still with the king size bed) with our own private patio overlooking a courtyard with fountains. I was also informed that all rooms do not come with a patio or balcony or a safe as they had indicated on their website. She told me I was mistaken in reading that, so if you want that you better call ahead and verify exactly what you are getting. Overall, we had a great time and would definitely recommend the Royal Palms if you can afford it. The guys at the pool were wonderful and we enjoyed the pool side restaurant every day for lunch.

The resort fee included all Bell and Valet gratuities which we thought was great, and the service was top notch. Over all the feeling was very high end, the atmosphere attractive, and the staff paid attention to all of the little details that every property wishes all of their staff would pay attention to.Honestly our trips to Arizona are mostly leisure and take us to the Sedona area, but we would consider making a special trip to spend an extra day or two at this property, we really want to use the spa next time, our brief tour looked really good.

The resort is absolutely beautiful, the rooms are outstanding, and the spa was beyond words. We were told at check-in that the resort was fully committed, yet we felt almost as if we were the only ones there! Our casita consisted of a living room, bedroom and large bathroom - more than enough room for the 3 of us to comfortably relax. We also had a patio that overlooked a lovely courtyard area that had a fountain and several wood fireplace pits. They were lit on Friday night but not the others, which was a little disappointing.

I would like to comment on one event that happened during our stay that explains why the Royal Palms is royal in my book....during her massage, my mother and her massage therapist were talking about where we had eaten the night prior and my mom commented that we had eaten at T. Cooks. She asked my mom what she had for dinner and my mom told her the duck. She asked her if she enjoyed it and my mom said yes, but that it had been a little dry.

I had researched many resorts and had narrowed my choices to the Lake Austin Spa Resort and the Royal Palms. The Royal Palms was clearly a more interesting destination with options outside of the resort that were endless, so I chose it. I booked through Expedia and while the RP was either the most expensive or 2nd most expensive choice in the PHX/Scottsdale area, it seemed to be the best fit. The descriptions on this site and at the RP website indicated its small and personal feel and service, which was appealing. The website won me over with the awards list and the beautiful photos, especially those showing its proximity to Camelback Mtn. I booked the package (air and hotel) well in advance- at least 4 months and figured I would begin making spa, restaurant and excursion reservations about one month out. Long story short, it is very important to call in advance (as soon as you book would be best) in order to get your preferred times to dine at T. Cooks for dinner (breakfast and lunch res. not required) and especially at the spa. The times I had asked for intitially were unavailable, even one month in advance. Also, when you speak to someone, take their name and then call again a few weeks before your trip to confirm your appts. It was all worked out before we arrived and we were welcomed with fabulous service, but I felt like most of that was due to my frequent contact beforehand. Be sure plan ahead if you stay at the RP...your trip will only be worth the expense if you plan each detail so as not to miss out on all of the opportunities and inclusions in staying here. The only reasons I did not give this resort a full 5 are: Although the resort does not claim to be adults only, all of the reviews and even the RP website alludes to this. We were there during a insurance brokers conference and many brokers had brought their children with them. While this was only a minor issue, it is worth noting that at a resort with a pool area that is so intimate, childrens voices (even joyful ones) carry and tend to interfere slightly with the romantic and peaceful atmosphere.Even when you book ahead of time, the charges in the spa are a) never the same as what you saw online or were quoted and b) always seemingly random (literally as if the numbers were simply drawn from a lottery) and WAY over-priced. Check your bill carefully. If you speak to someone in charge, they will correct the bill, but it will be time consuming. The spa is fabulous and while I am willing to pay $500 a night for a room, paying more than $150 for a very standard 60 minute massage is ridiculous. Thinking that I would have been disappointed with only one day at the spa, I booked two mornings full of spa activities and services on the 2nd and 4th days of our stay. If I could do it all over again, I would simply ask for the 90 minute massage (confirm the price in writing ahead of time) and leave the spa treatments to that. This was worth every penny. The 60 minute massage and manicure were overpriced and not nearly relaxing or enjoyable enough to justify the price. I found myself anxious the entire time I should have been enjoying these treatments b/c I knew that I was spending hundreds of dollars on something that had less than $100 of value to me. On the last day we stayed, a motley crew of people that looked as if they belonged in a trashy music video took over the pool. They ordered grey goose and champagne as if it were going out of style (beginning before noon) and played their loud music and smoked their cigarettes while dancing their scantily clad bodies around the pool. They even brought their yapper of a dog to run around wildly and bother the guests. While these folks obviously had paid (on credit no doubt) for the two cabanas they inhabited it didnt matter b/c the size of the pool and area were only modestly larger than a large residential pool. Please also keep in mind that the past few days (while many children had been present) were quite peaceful and the pool had only been visited by folks with similar interests (sunbathing, having maybe 1 or 2 drinks and lunch and enjoyng the peaceful and romantic atmosphere). While Rick was fab. by asking them to keep quiet and not physically invade the other guests space, there was nothing he could do but keep bringing them their drinks and grin and bear it. Needless to say, we did not stay at the pool more than 5 minutes on our last day, which was disappointing. I am not sure how the RP could have prevented this occurance, but I am shocked that those sorts of people chose the RP for their party. It certainly was not a good match!THANKS are deserved! The special touches at the RP are what makes it worth the cost. While you could stay at the Bellagio for less, no one there will remember your name, which pool chair you like or whether you prefer red or white. You certainly wont be receiving personally signed notes at the beginnning and end of your stay, nor rose petal covered bedding or chocolate covered strawberries as a surprise at turn-down. The staff was superb and especially gracious and friendly. The grounds are beautiful. The food and service are great. The suite is worth the extra $- having the extra room is great for couples with different sleeping habits.TIPS: Place a personal item on a pool chair early in the morning to get your preferred spot. (The sun is strong, so be sure to wear sunscreen at all times.) Be sure to go to Camelback Mtn. for a few hikes- the ones recommended in the brochure are great- for all levels. Sunset horsesback riding is highly recommended. While the crowd youll be with for 4 hours isnt the classiest, the views are breathtaking. Go to arizona-horses for one option. Skip the shopping, especially if you live in a more metropolitan area. T. Cooks is as good as any restaurant off site, so if I had it to do again I would have dined there each evening I was interested in a more formal meal. For informal, do a steakhouse or cookout with the horseback riding and be sure to check out Pizza Bianco. The Bar Bianco and Pizza rest. are well worth the wait. It is such a cute set-up on a lovely evening. Also, youll be right next to the stadium, so you can check that out, too. If you decide to rent a car (which you dont need to do unless you plan to leave the resort more than once per day), def. do the convertible. We did and did not regret it.

I have never seen a more beautiful property. The air smelled sweet and flowers were blooming everywhere you turned. Walks through the property led you to discover wonderful little secret gardens and courtyards everywhere. It is hard to believe the previous review stating they walked ten minutes to the front desk. It doesnt take ten minutes to get anywhere at Royal Palms. Yes the pool is small but that was one of the things I loved. I hate large overcrowded resort pools with worn chairs and no personal service or ambiance. I do understand that some rooms are better than the others but the purpose of darker rooms is to give you a respite from the hot Arizona sun. It is to give the best of both worlds. Beautiful, bright exterior and cool and calm interiors. We all must take some responsibility when we travel and do as much research as possible. It is very clear everywhere you read that the hotel restaurant T. Cooks is well known and reservations are strongly recommended in advance. If you are a fan of big, trendy resorts with 3 pools and many restaurants with rooms that all look the same then this hotel is not for you.

Possibly the casitas in the old section are what gives it its rating. We did not see one.Our corner Plaze suite was BIG and an extremely long walk through two courtyards (my heart began sinking when I saw the first courtyard. I had an idea what we were in for as I saw open windows and the people in the rooms and closed windows along the dark halls I was walking in). The door to our room opened to a large, lovely living room with loud, admittedly pretty, stereo music greeting us. All blinds were closed, here and in the bedroom which adjoined. When I opened them, I realized why - The bedroom looked out on the air conditioning system - six huge compressors. I tried to open the window - not a chance!The living room looked out on a dark hall and blank wall with a table against it to stop the eye. Those windows didnt open either. We were in sunny Arizona with no way of breathing the air unless we propped our door open and craned our necks to see some sun and sky. When we turned the stereo down we could hear the roar. Even when we left it on, as we did all night, there was still a strange high-pitched noise we could not obliterate.I walked the 10 minute walk back to the front desk, with a wonderfully patient bellman working his second job while trying to get a real estate license, to ask for a different choice. My husband, who had just broken his elbow horseback riding, waited. I was told I had booked the new Plaza area. I had never been told the difference. The only other available room, I was told, was a deluxe room (no living room, which might have been OK with me in exchange for air) so we went to look. That had a balcony, and an opening door, overlooking...the parking lot.I didnt bother trying other choices. Actually, supposedly there were none. There were rooms that looked across a courtyard at other rooms. Not much of a choice. If your room faced the road and the hall, the other option, your windows didnt open because it would be too noisy. We actually could still hear the cars through the fan vent in the bathroom ceiling.As mentioned in other letters, the pool is too crowded. The restaurant was fully booked for dinner when we got there, but no one had suggested when I reserved a room that I also reserve for dinner. In a way, we turned out to be lucky as it was mostly closed in like the rooms.I could go on as our daughter and her husband and two sons, for whom I had also booked a room, had sililarly difficult experiences.What did I learn? Always ask if the windows open. Just because American Express says its a Fine Hotel, dont believe it! Dont believe the pictures. Saving grace, our room faced east and a lovely sunrise wakened us.

So be our EIGHT YEAR run at the Royal Palms Resort in Phoenix. We thought about changing our annual hotel destination this year, 2006 but decided, why change something that has usually been good? Well, we found out why. The front desk staff needs some training and they need to learn how to treat a guest who has been a faithful to their hotel for this many return visits. First, our room choice had been requested for a month prior to our trip...then on the day of arrival a very specific room was asked for and was available, only to be given away 5 minutes before we were given our room, after we waited all day for the room to be cleaned etc. Then we were told no roll aways anymore...all of our previous visits we have had one. So this was an issue this year... new rule.That was a problem since the hotel was sold out for the night. We were unable to have beds for all guests in our room, then the staff was not accomodating in finding an alternative. They offered The Ritz, which is not a Resort/Spa. We had to find our own alternative accomodations at 10 p.m. Friday night and it basically ruined our evening and the next day as we had to check out and move the next day although moving to the PHOENICIAN was a Pleasant one. WE have always had problems with the bills being incorrect at Royal Palms (we did for our one night too!) and the pool service, they had one nice guy at the RP taking care of the entire pool, when they knew they were entirely booked at their hotel. He was overworked and a little cranky! but we understood his plight. We just dont spend that kind of money to relax for a weekend away to be treated so poorly and with such disrespect for our vacation time. We will definitely be writing to the Royal Palms to let them know their returning guests will be no longer...not that they care! We will be happy to go to the Phoenician where our rooms were large and spacious with superb, expediant service in every arena of the hotel. They may be a little larger, but wow, the service there is impeccable. p.s. No maid service was knocking on doors at 8:30 on a weekend morning at the Phoenician, like at the Royal Palms...they need a few lessons on luxury accomodations..As we were checking out of the RP, we noticed a lovely older couple who were wondering why they did not have the Casita they had reserved 6 months in advance...they were very upset as well...They were heading to the Four Seasons!We will definitely not go back, too many other mishaps to list.

When I was planning the trip, I had assumed that our future memories of this vacation would center around the majesty of the Grand Canyon and our unique closeness to it (We stayed at the Buckey ONeill suite, the oldest standing structure in the Grand Canyon area). I was completely wrong. While the Grand Canyon was indeed majestic, our enjoyment of this national treasure paled greatly in comparison to our experience at the Royal Palms. I have stayed at a few 5-star hotels in the last few years, and was expecting similar exemplary service and fine dining. My expectations were greatly exceeded. The grounds are exquisite (there are many secret gardens waiting to be found, and while the hotel had no vacancies when we stayed, we almost always felt like we were the only guests), the spa was very high class, the rooms were beautifully decorated and modern (with a touch of old-world style with the four-poster beds), the food at T Cooks was excellent (room service was also provided by T Cooks), and the service was absolutely incredible. The last reviewer described service as lacking. He must have been staying at some Bizarro-world Royal Palms. Every hotel worker I passed greeted me with a smile and a hello (often congratulaing us on our honeymoon), restaurant service and room service were prompt, and when we checked out, they did express a desire to see us again (as if this really matters at all--boy, that last reviewer was picky!). But beyond this basic 5-star treatment, the service staff went above and beyond anything I had ever experienced before.One example: I bookended my trip with the Royal Palms (one night at the start of the trip and one night at the end, after the Grand Canyon). When we pulled into the Royal Palms picturesque driveway on the last night, not only were we greeted by name by the bellhops, but were shown immediately to our room, with no need to check-in. The Royal Palms, without my asking, has upgraded us to a villa (with two private courtyards) from a simple casita. In addition, by our bedside, they had given us an additional present (a CD of southwestern music) and a letter thanking us for choosing the Royal Palms for the first night of our honeymoon and for returning. They went out of their way to make my honeymoon special. This was extremely personalized service at its best.I used Trip Advisor, as well as Conde Nast (Royal Palms is on the Gold List) and Travel  Leisure (Rated as one of the Top 50 U.S. hotels and the top hotel in Phoenix/Scottsdale) to pick a Phoenix/Scottsdale resort. On Trip Advisor, while other resorts have similar overall ratings, if you compare the user reviews of the other five-star hotels to the Royal Palms, youll notice that reviews for the Royal Palms are much more overwhelmingly positive.

We never heard a raised voice, saw a scowling face or felt as if we werent the most important guests there.The food in the restaurants is wonderful if just a little pricey but then again, youre paying for unsurpassed quality and service. T. Cooks serves marvelous meals and the Cabana Grill has wonderfully casual lunches (and breakfast brunch on Sundays) and poolside drinks. The poolside service is unsurpassed and again, Rick and Jose (I cant say enough good things about the two of you either!!!) make you feel as if youre visiting their home. And by the joy they demonstrate when doing their jobs, its no wonder you feel that way.We didnt use the spa but we visited the boutique area and it was beautiful as well and also well stocked with a wide assortment of spa products.On our last night there, we had the privilege of attending the General Managers reception in the Presidential Villa (where President Bush had stayed just 2 weeks prior...regardless of your politics, its pretty cool to know youre standing in the bedroom where a world leader has recently slept!). Our wonderful friend Jose was there and we also had the joy of meeting Greg Miller, the GM, Rick Behr, Delores (I hope I spelled your name correctly!) the Director of Experiences, and Gregory Casale, the head chef. They were all entertaining and charming and we had lovely drinks and hors doeuvres which made for a great send-off on our last night. We were truly sad to leave them, in fact when we left to go back to our casita, Jose made a point of stopping us and letting us know what a pleasure it had been to have us stay with them. It felt so much like saying good-bye to a friend that we hugged him before we left.My husband had seen the resort on Great Hotels on the Travel Channel but could not remember the exact name of the resort. Since we had never been to Phoenix before, that meant we had to search through every other high-end resort property before he recognized the Royal Palms from its pictures. Even after having looked at all those other properties, we just had a feeling about the Royal Palms and we couldnt have been happier to have made the choice we did. There will be no other place for us to stay on any future visits to Phoenix. Why would we? Coming back to the Royal Palms would be like coming home.And as a testament to the commitment to service and care the Royal Palms offers, look at the negative reviews of any of the other comparable resorts. Do you see any responses from those properties management? No. And in the scant negative comments Ive seen about the Royal Palms (both of which seemed to come from completely unreasonable people in my opinion), they took the time to respond and see if they could make things right. That says it all to me.This is the finest property in Phoenix, hands down. I dont need to stay anywhere else to know that. Thank you to everyone at the Royal Palms who made our stay with you an absolute joy. We will be back!!

The thunderstorm had forced the plane to circle the airport and were delayed further because the plane had to refuel for the long flight to PHX. We were supposed to get in around 5pm Phoenix time and then drive a few hours north to Williams, however that was not going to be feasible because of the delay of almost six hours. The hotel for which we were originally booked was gracious enough to understand and cancelled our first night. So now we needed a place to stay the night. The Sleep Inn Airport had great rates online and plenty of non-smoking rooms available that night when we booked early in Chicago. However by the time we got there they turned away two phone calls saying they had no vacancy. Since they had a free airport shuttle, they probably filled up with weary travelers like us at last minute.The shuttle took a little time getting to us, and the place where you pick up your shuttle does not feel very secure, but I fault that more to the sprawling design of Sky Harbor Airport and the not so great neighborhood surrounding it. We were waiting for another guest who had called for the shuttle but was nowhere to be found. The driver called the hotel, who in turn called the guest, and found that the person was in the middle of the taxi area. After making our way there to pick up the guest, we were off the hotel. It is not on the grounds of the airport, but not a considerable distance away either. When we arrived we were pleased to see how nicely lit up the hotel was.Check-in was prompt: Sign, swipe and go. There seem to be two parts to this hotel. An older part and newer part because the hallway does an awkward jut to the left and through a door on the first floor. Our room was first floor about half way down the hallway from the desk. The hotel was quiet as to be expected at almost midnight to 1am-ish. Room was the basic, no frills older Sleep Inn design of built in furniture and everything out in the open. It also had a stand-up shower only but had great pressure and extra hot water. Exhaust fan was not very good at all, but water vapor dissipaits quickly in dry PHX. Bed was average, sheets were nice, pillows were good. Steam iron worked great.In the morning the continental breakfast was your typical standard fare plus those wonderful make them yourself belgian waffles. Everything was fresh and tasty. Check out was fast and no surprises and the attendant called the shuttle for us. The shuttle took us back in the morning to the airport so we could catch the rental car bus to the facility and the driver dropped us at the appropriate place and helped with our luggage.All in all a good clean hotel to spend the night and a good value for the weary traveler.

Even if it was closed, I could push it open! We called maintenance and they fixed it while we were out one day. While the door was indeed fixed, they left the other door to the unit slightly ajar when they left! We could have had stuff stolen out of the room. Thankfully nothing was, but it was beyond careless that they left the other door open upon completion (we are sure that we did not leave it open - it was obvious that maintenance was using that door while they were repairing the other one).

I joined him for the last 5 nights before we headed off touring. Despite having a high level Hilton Honors priviledge card, he got a very ordinary room, surprisingly small compared to say the average high end motel room, and was told nothing else was available, when he checked in. They gave him a few complimentary vouchers for the cheapest breakfast available on site, instead. When he got to the room, it had yet to be serviced. Two days later, he returned to his room mid morning to get some papers he had left inside by accident. The keycard would not work. He ran to reception where it was reissued. It still didnt work. Long story, short - 5 maintenance staff members and 45 minutes later, he got access to the room. Of course, by now, he was extremely late for a meeting where he had to make a presentation. They gave him a $20 voucher for his inconvenience!!!!! The room was very tired - furniture scuffed and old fashioned, drapes faded, paintwork scratched, bathroom fixtures scoured until the base metal was exposed, that kind of thing. The desk was too small to do any work on and use a PC at the same time, it had an old-fashioned TV with a poor screen. Worse, the airconditioning was extremely noisy and the thermostat very insensitive. It turns itself off for long periods, then the fan comes on at maximum warp to cool the room down in a hurry, then runs a little more quietly before shutting off. This cycle is not conducive to a peaceful nights sleep.My first day, arriving jet-lagged from the UK, they had a water problem. I ended up having a cold shower in the morning, but there was NO water by 10.00 am. Guests were told they could use the facilities in the spa building, 5 minutes walk away. While the water was off, housekeeping did the room. How you can clean a bathroom properly and hygienically without water, nobody ever managed to explain to my satisfaction. Further, there was evidence of remedial repair works going on around the accommodation blocks, and the nearest elevator to the room was out of order for the whole of my husbands 12 night stay.This hotel has a large pool and water activity based leisure facility. This is ideal for families with children and people wanting to relax and sunbathe. If you spend most of your time here, you will probably consider the property not bad. If you mostly just use the rooms, you are unlikely to be impressed. The best feature, to me, was a reasonably comfortable bed.While the front of house staff were polite and embarrassed at the shortcomings, and claimed they wanted to help with the problems we encountered, they didnt actually achieve much or offer anything positive or genuinely meaningful to alieviate the situation. The other staff members we encountered - housekeeping and ground staff - seemingly spoke little or no english and just put on a smile because they had been trained to do so.

Upon check in there was a line out the door, they only had two people checking everyone in, when it was our turn it was a quick process, we got our keys and headed to our room. There are no inside corridors so that was a pain, but we were able to park right outside our building. The Luggage carts were chained to a fence so we had to call the front desk so they could send someone over to unlock them for us, very tacky as it was 100 + out and we just wanted to get into our room.We got to our smoke free room - finally...and it looked like it was recently remodeled, nice large rooms, and a bonus to have a separate bedroom from the living area. The room however smelled of old cigarette smoke (which I am highly allergic to), my guess is that at one time it was a smoking room. So thank goodness we brought Fabreeze with us and sprayed the entire room down, including the curtains (we had called the front desk and it sounded like thats all housekeeping would be able to do for us as well)The first morning we were there, we were awakened at 8:30 am by the front desk saying our credit card had been declined (how come we werent notified upon check in), I knew this to be an error as I had PLENTY of room on my card...I told them I would call my bank and find out what was going on....upon talking with the credit card company the hotel had placed 5 authorizations on my credit card in the following amounts....$1183.00, $1183.00, $800.00, $600.00, and $500.00. They couldnt get my card to go through...NO WONDER, they froze up over $4,500.00 on my credit card, and anyone who knows anything about credit cards ( I worked in the banking industry for almost 10 years), when a company does an authorization it puts a hold on those funds for 5 -6 business days!!! until the charges are processed.So they maxed out my credit card. I called the front desk and they said that was impossible that that could not have happened, I told them, the $$$ amounts that the credit card company had told me they placed. I told them there is no way I would know the $$$ amounts if the money wasnt being held by them.To make a very very long story short, it took 4 hours that day to get it somewhat sorted out, my CC company told me I needed the Hilton to call them and remove all of the authorizations from my card, the front desk said they were not authorizations that my CC had been rejected those 5 times.It took 5 DAYS to get the messed cleared up and sorted out (funny how they had called my CC company and had those authorizations removed - but declined that that could happened), The hotel tried to tell us that our card was rejected at check in....I dont know about you but if it was rejected at the time of check in...1. Why would you give us keys?2. Notify us at check in that there was a problem with our card.3. Ask if we wanted to put our room on another card.If our credit card was rejected the above should never have happened and we should not have spent our whole 5 days dealing with getting their authorizations removed from our CC so we could continue our vacation. We demanded that they compensate us for all the time and frustration they caused us and ruining our vacation and they offered us a free lunch (we paid for breakfast in our package deal but did not get breakfast that first day because of dealing with this so they offered us lunch instead) and $40.00 additional, we told them that wasnt good enough, that we felt at least one nights stay (we stayed 5 nights) was more acceptable, finally after arguing in the lobby they offered us an additional $50.00.Upon check out, on our final bill that is slipped under the door, there was a $75.00 charge for dinner (which we did not make) and there was only a $40.00 credit.

This is a king bedroom, with queen sofa bed. We were really pleased with the room, as normally always get 2 queen beds (rooms are a little bigger). Room on the East side (less intense afternoon sun).

Can also hike at Dreamy Draw Park which is on the North side of Squaw Peak, lots of trails, and easy 1mi drive from hotel. Camelback mountain, 3mi to parking. 1.25mi 1200ft climb. Two routes, East and West. Recommend West route, but limited parking at Echo Canyon, more parking 0.6mi away. Get there early on weekends.North Mountain.

Even with the bratty kids we still enjoyed ourselves, you CAN bring your own floats in the pools(and lazy river) along with drinks to the pools outside of the water park.

It had a king-sized bed(extremely comfortable), a shower  tub with the vanity outside of the bathroom and a fridge in the closet. There was a stinky smell coming from the sink but that was a minor issue. Nice flat screen on the wall. I do agree with other posters that you can really hear your neighbors, but that didnt bother us too bad.Restaurants - After reading the reviews on here we skipped the restaurants. We walked in the Hole In the Wall for breakfast on Friday morning and left after noone acknowledged us after 10 minutes. We were impressed with the pina coladas at the hotel bar; beer and drinks prices were average for a resort. We ate at Gallaghers Sports Bar (right off the property) twice and it was average bar food, nothing spectacular.

We stayed at the Squaw Peak resort in late May/early June and had a very relaxing time. I had spent a lot of time researching various hotels in the Phoenix area and settled on the Squaw Peak because it appeared to be quite kid friendly from what we read, including the reviews on TripAdvisor. Our kids, aged 8,10 and 14 had a great time. The lazy river and pools were a big hit, especially with our younger kids. The check in process went smoothly (we booked through United Vacation.com and got a great deal on the lodging as well as the flight from Denver) and we were given one of the standard rooms with a bedroom with 2 queens and a separate living area with a foldout sofa. When we checked in we were told to check back in a couple days about a possible upgrade. I did check back, and we did receive a room upgrade on about our third day at the resort. The upgraded room was a two story casita, with plenty of room for our family of five to spread out. Much nicer than the standard room.We stayed a total of 9 nights at the resort and truly enjoyed it. We had been concerned that the heat would be unbearable but as it was Phoenix was blessed with a few days of relatively cooler weather in late May before it started to warm up, gradually. Didnt really matter to us as we spent a lot of time around the pools.The breakfasts at Lantana Grille and the Hole in the Wall at the River Ranch were pretty good. We tended to go off-resort for other meals - there are some decent places to eat quite close to the resort. We did do dinner at the Hole in the Wall one evening but the service was terrible - in fact my wife and kids got tired of waiting for the food and left - we ended up eating it in our room.I used the fitness facilities at the Tocasierra Fintness Center a number of times and found it satisfactory, with plenty of equipment - although a couple of the treadmills were not very stable. My wife and eldest daughter also indulged with spa treatments, and although somewhat pricey, they did find them enjoyable.The River Ranch was the big hit of our vacation, and there was never a problem finding lounge chairs, towels, etc. - although getting service at your lounge chair on the weekend days can be a bit frustrating due to the volume of people.We also took the free shuttle over to the Tapatio Cliffs resort on a couple occassions. The main pool area at that resort is also quite nice, and I found the bar area actually a little livlier. The fact that we could use the facilities of both resorts is a real plus in my mind.I travel quite a bit both domestically and internationally, and while the Squaw Peak is a nice place, with decent amenities and mostly very good service, I would not rate it a premier resort.

The facility itself was good, the staff and every employee we needed to encounter treated us with respect. Spending a lot of time in the water park I did notice some problems and the first being people being there that had no business being there, my impression was that only guest that were book at the hotel are allowed to use the water park. Over all I would recommend this hotel for people with kids who need to burn off some energy but would think twice if I were staying there alone or as a couple.

The casita was in need of updating, had a musty smell, and my colleague and I had to call maintenance the first night because the carpet outside the downstairs bathroom was wet and there was a dripping noise. They concluded that the previous guests had probably left a leaky cooler there and brought in a noisy fan we let run overnight- it was there for the rest of our stay. The resort is sprawling- not ideal for people attended a conference who want to pop into their rooms in between sessions. The conference facilities were great other than the 3rd floor (rooftop) rooms, which were way too warm. The restaurants are OK, but the more casual of the two is certainly overpriced.

We are HiltonRewards members and used out points to stay at the Hilton in Sedona (fabulous), the DoubleTree in Durango, (wonderful), and the Point Hilton Squaw Peak Resort in Phoenix...not so much.First of all, the air didnt work - it was 112 when we got there. Nothing was ever done. Second, we had ANTS...everywhere. The blinds didnt work and the housekeeper kept moving our things around to where she wanted them. The resort itself seemed run down. The pictures made it look much larger than it is. A professional miniature golf course winds around the lazy river at River ranch and inner tubes covered the whole golf course. We, along with several other people couldnt even follow where the holes were. One minute you were on top of a hill, and the next minute you had to cross over a hole someone else was playing to get to your next hole. While we were there, they also had an adolescent basketball conference. Banging of doors, yelling, running up and down the stairs, and yes, one night some kids tried to break into our room. Unfortunately, I was in it! I chased them down the corridor and made sure they understood I didnt find their attempts funny. All, in all, not the most relaxing time. I must say, however, that the HIlton in Sedona was absolutely fantastic, as was the DoubleTree in Durango, Co.

Well, let me tell you - going to a resort in the off season, is not all its cracked up to be! When we checked in, the staff were NOT friendly, no one offered any help with baggage, and they did not give us the coupon book we were supposed to get or our $50 dinner coupons. Our room was okay, but the shower/tub did not drain. Our neighbors were packed about 20 to a room and there were constantly huge bags of garbage sitting out in front of their door. None of the elevators worked (we were on the 3rd floor) and none of the ice machines worked. The pool areas were nice enough - of course, when we got there, we couldnt get tubes for the lazy river because the pump to blow them up was broken. It just seemed like everything was broken or out of order. When we asked the person at the front desk about the coupons we never got and the dinner vouchers, he was completely unhelpful and pretty much told us, Sorry bout it - it was your responsibility. No, actually is wasnt my responsibility, I dont work there!! So, if youre planning on staying here, you might want to reconsider - the staff are not very friendly, and definitely do not feel they should go out of their way to accomodate you. I can say that both nights we ate at the Lantana Grille lounge and the food was very good and our server was an absolute joy!

The casita was nice and located on a little street that resembled a real neighborhood with the houses, tree lined streets and carports.

I hope they will consider improving the lighting as soon as possible.As for my suite, I couldnt have been more comfortable. Even the prints on the walls were interesting and atttractive. I felt pampered with the bedding, the furniture, and my own living room. Early in the morning, I enjoyed the canopy view of the tree-tops from my balcony, and even took some pictures of the birds in the trees.The water park was awesome!! Even grown-ups without kids were enjoying the pools and the lazy river. The big pool with the waterfall was wonderful, and you could quickly cool off under that.Prices at the Slim Pickens Grill were rather high - $16 for a hot dog and a pina colada smoothie, but it was convenient. The Hole in the Wall restaurant was very good. I had a nice dinner of ribs (mouth-watering), with the best biscuits Ive had in a long time. Breakfast was also good, and the staff was very friendly.The conciege was very helpful, and had printed-out directions for the Heard Museum and the Car Rental Return at the airport.

First the good:1) The recently-completed renovations are beautiful. The guest rooms are spacious, modern, clean and well-appointed. The grounds are very nice.2) The check-in process was smooth and efficient and the front desk clerk was very friendly. A bellman offered to take our luggage and show us to our room.3) The water park was great! The main pool, lazy river, jacuzzi and tad pool (for the wee ones) were fun and the kids and I had an awesome time.Now the bad:Food service is atrocious at this resort. Nearly every experience we had with food was a bad experience. From poor service, long wait times and poor food quality, the food and beverage department at this resort needs a major overhaul.For example, we went to breakfast at the Hole In The Wall on Saturday morning and had the breakfast buffet. The eggs were powdered, the biscuits were rock hard (inedible), the bacon was hard, dry and chewy, etc. Not very good.On Saturday evening for room service, we ordered the special Family Summer Splash Pizza, Salad, Wings and Soda combo, at a cost of over $43. It took over an hour for the food to arrive, the pizza was luke warm, the wings had been burnt and had black spots on them, the salad for four was actually only enough lettuce for one adult, and the room service attendant made no effort to apologize for any delay. I ended up calling the room service line and asking for more salad, which I got.On Sunday morning, I went to the gift shop to get a cup of Starbucks coffee. When I pumped it out of the airpot, it was lukewarm. When I asked if they had a microwave to warm it up in, I was told there wasnt one in the gift shop and that if I wanted hot, fresh coffee, I should go to the lobby where they might have some there. It was only after I complained about the coffee not being hot or fresh that the lady offered to brew another pot.These are just a couple of examples of the problems with the food service at this resort. Which is too bad because the rest of the resort is absolutely worth the money. We got a special $123 per night local summer rate, and I know there are rates as low as $79 per night during the week.The only other issue was the high number of summer teen employees working there that didnt seem too interested in anything other than running around together and having a good time. I encountered several, at various times throughout my stay, that ran past me, one that ignored my request for information (he just looked at me as he walked past and never responded) and another that didnt know what hours the tennis courts were open till and didnt offer to find out.Despite these issues, I would recommend this resort, and do plan to return with my family, but will be keeping a close eye on the food service and may even go out to restaurants off of the resort grounds to eat while there.

Each of the buildings also has its separate pool. Another plus for me was that the hotel is very close to the Arizona Canal, which is a great place to run or bike. One negative is that this hotel, unlike the other Pointe Hilton resorts in the area, does not have a gourmet restaurant. Its two restaurants are just average.

Another nice feature is the separate bedroom in the suites. The outside of the property feels dated circa 1970s, but it is solid, large and quiet. I never had a problem with noise. One tip: get a courtyard view room in the FRONT of the North bldg. it overlooks a pretty pool and fountain and is quieter than the South bldg. the pool also gets mostly adults.This is not the best hotel for a romantic getaway, but if you have kids and want to have fun, its great. The food is fine--not gourmet but fine. the only thing I did not like was no Wifi-you have to pay $12 per 24 hours for Internet service, which I find tacky.

I asked for a first floor room with a pool view but even though I requested 4 mos. prior they could not accommodate. We had a 3rd floor room with partial view of the pool. The rooms were perfect for a family. Two very comfortable queen beds, separated by a pocket door from the bathroom/toilet area, then doors again which separated the living area. This was perfect to put kids to bed and we could still watch tv. Also, my husband the snorer was kicked out into the living area/pull out couch so the rest of us could sleep and we never heard him.The balcony is so small and awful view, we didnt sit out there even once. I knew there was no refrigerator so we purchased a cooler at Walgreens right down the street and bought milk, juice, cereal and fruit so we didnt have to waste time or money going out to breakfast in the morning. We bought a big cooler and then just sent it home as luggage on the way home.The resort is very nice, well kept and beautiful. Very large palm trees and beautiful flowers. The pool area is also nice.

The water slide was very fast and the kids loved it. My kids also enjoyed the putt putt, though some of the holes could use a lift. We all played tennis one morning an d that was fun too. My major complaint about this place is that, I booked it due to the multitude of organized kids activities so that my husband and I could relax some. Apparently Spring Break had just ended in AZ so they scaled back on what they offered. There was a board posted at every hotel area indicating there would be pool activities every day at 10, 11, 1, 3, and 5 which included races, basketball games, water volley ball, slide races, watermelon eating contests, hoola hoop contests etc. Well we were there for seven days and there were two hoola hoop contests and one slide race. (that was it for the week). We continuously asked the pool staff when the next activity would be. They just had excuse after excuse. I realize Spring Break ended for them but the vacationers were on their Spring Break. My kids were very good at keeping themselves busy but after a few days it would have been nice if someone could have organized some activities for the kids. Even though I loved this place, this really irked me!!!!!We ate at the Hole in the Wall, very mediocre and pricey. The food at the pool was pricey. However, an adult sandwich was chock full of meat and kept all of us happy well until dinner. Most sandwiches were $9. Beers were $5 and up and mixed drinks around $8.We walked to Aunt Chiladas one night which was very good. Also Gallaghers across the street (pub food), sports bar which was good. Lantana Grille was very good. There are two hotel courtyards each with a pool and swim up bar. Both swim up bars were closed the whole week (also weird and disappointing), We enjoyed using these pools later in the day which was much quieter than the water park and very comfy chairs. AS there was no service here, we just packed a cooler and brought our own drinks,.No night life here to speak of. IN the past we have done an all inclusive vacation, where there is entertainment at night and then the adults sit around and socialize a bit. There was none of that here. The resort was quiet by 9:00.The fitness room is fantastic. New modern equipment, classes offered, it couldnt have been better.We went to the Grand Canyon one day and made it in 3 1/2 hrs. . Cut through Flagstaff and it shaves a little of the trip. Also went to Sedona one day. Awesome!! You have to do the Pink Jeep Broken Arrow tour as everyone says.

The room was clean, the bed was fluffy and soft, and the location of our room was in a quiet area away from most of the traffic. One thing you may want to consider is that quarters are tight in the shower, and tall people may have a problem with this. Unlike the casitas, the studios do not have an assigned parking spot.

I stayed as a business traveler who needed easy accessibility to downtown during the time. BUT, as a former Phoenician, it also gave me great access to all the things I loved about living in Phoenix: the Biltmore shopping area, Scottsdale Fashion Square, Camelback and Squaw Peak. It is enough out of the way to give you the resort feel, but still in the midst of everything. Although I enjoyed my stay, some business travelers may find that this hotel is a little too family-oriented for them. I was there during the last week of spring training and it was P-A-C-K-E-D. However, I was still able to enjoy the property. As a business traveler, it is important to me to be able to maintain a fitness routine. The Hilton Squaw Peak has a very nice fitness center and I didnt ever find it to be too crowded at peak evening hours. I was told that it was recently updated, so everything was in great shape. (Only suggestion I have for the hotel: balance your treadmills...a few were a bit wobbly on their legs!) Plenty of cardio machines and an extensive weight lifting area. Pretty great! Not to mention that you have access to Squaw Peak trails which is a nice bonus for the months when it is cool enough to be outside.The rooms are also quite large, which is great for being able to spread out. I had a suite on the ground floor near the pool / lobby. Even though there were lots of families who were up late, I didnt find it to be a distraction in my room. I also liked that my unit had a patio - which again, is great if it is cool enough to be outside. Thanks for a pleasant stay.

I was very satisfied w/ the room lay-out. EVERY room is a suite and for a family, this is ideal!! When one person woke early or wanted to stay up late, there was a seperate room to accomodate that...really makes for a more comfortable stay!! On a negative note, the resort layout is rather cramped. When you add the crowds of Spring Break, it really was pushing it. The lazy river looked like a rush hour traffic jam! Overall, it was a great trip. Id like to specifically mention the top notch fitness club. It was clean, modern and the staff were great!! Fitness Director, Keene was our guide on a hotel sponsored hike. He was great!! Kind, fun and professional...what more do you want in an employee!!

It has a door upstairs into the room, where as the king casita does not. So you can hear the TV going downstairs. And the sleeper sofa has a thin mattress and it is very uncomfortable.

Concierge staff was incredibly knowledgable and helpful (thank you, Dave, Joan and Carol), with good advice on trips to Sedona and local sites and restaurant choices.The biggest disappointment was the on-property dining, which was mediocre and overpriced. We had opted for the bounce-back breakfast. The vouchers covered only a couple of menu items. The staff at both the family oriented Hole in the Wall and the fancier Lantana Grill kept trying to direct us to the pricey breakfast buffet. At the Hole in the Wall it was awful -- soggy french toast, cold eggs, a few pastries -- more like school cafeteria than good resort.

When I called the hotel, the front desk clerk was very helpful and confirmed that the suite theyd set aside for us was indeed ready, so we headed straight for the resort.Upon check-in, which was handled very smoothly, we were informed of the resort option package, which provides a number of amenities (including fitness center access, spa discounts, and local phone calls) for $2.25 a day. As Hilton HHonors members, we were also given two complimentary bottles of water.After freshening up, we headed to the Hole in the Wall Restaurant for lunch. This was a bit nostalgic for me, as I grew up in Phoenix and friends and I had frequented the Hole in the Wall at its original location in its early days. The food was (and still is) basic burgers, sandwiches, and quesadillas, but well prepared and reasonably-priced (especially considering itéˆ¥æªš in a resort). The service was also excellent.Thus fortified, we set off to see The Parents.Over the next several days, our two-room suite became our sanctuary. It included a separate living room and bed room, robes (without having to ask), a very comfy bed, the fluffiest towels I have used in a long time (at home or away), a balcony, a well-stocked mini-bar, and some of the best in-room coffee Ive in a long time. While our room was in one of two multi-story buildings, the resort also offers casitas - single story structures away from the larger buildings and adjacent conference center.While the property has four restaurants, we only ate at the Hole in the Wall. However, we did use room service, which was also prompt, polite, and provided well-prepared fare.There are several pools available, including a small water park adjacent to the Hole in the Wall.

The resort is older so has its charm in that respect; it is not a new ultra luxurious over the top resort. The beds were comfy. I would go back.

Arrived about 5:15 pm and told we were upgraded to a King exc. suite - it was huge, 2 bathrooms, huge living room with of coure a board room table that would seat 12! Only thing was the sofa was not a pull-out for the boys. So much for the upgrade - went to another King suite, but it overlooked some roadwork and looked like we would trip over the boys so went for a 2 queen suite, 1st one offered was not 2 queens, and with the bell - hop hanging in there found us a 2 queen that we couldnt of been more pleased with. Overlooked the courtyard pool and was on the 4 th floor. Only a few areas have a 4th floor and it was very peaceful. My partner is a HH gold vip so 2 breakfast coupons were included each day. The childrens menu at both restaurants is very, very reasonable and plentiful. They have a lot of patio seating but very few umbrellas which is sad as it was too warm to sit in the full sun. We ate at Hole in the Wall our first night - convenient. It had a fire - pit that people were taking advantage of. They now have a resort special for $2.25 a day which includes an extra water park pass per day (not that anyone checks) and local phone calls which im using to connect to the internet rather then pay the $9.95 per day use!Pools were fine for the children, oh and fee includes the mini golf now. cant really sit in one spot and see the children all the time, so we found ourselves up and down looking for them even though they are 9 and 13 yrs! In a push wed come back again but would like to try some other resorts. went to the Different Pointe of View for thanksgiving dinner - what a view, definitely recommended. Glad we didnt stay at the other Hilton, needed a ride upto the restaurant and apparently not much other then a water slide for the kids - now they are spoilt!

The hotel was clean and everything was well maintained. We decided to go to Sedona for a day. It was beautiful but a bit boring for the kids so we drove to Slide (slip?)Rock State Park. Everyone enjoyed this river slide and the scenery is also wonderful. The kids didnt want to leave. Since we were halfway to the south rim of the Grand Canyon, we decided to go and catch the sunset. On the way, we called inside the park for a hotel room and got lucky. Incredible!!! Pictures cant do it justice. The next day, we took the in-park tour buses at no extra charge - although, the national parks should be free for US citizens, since we pay taxes. we left midday and drove back to Phoenix. A few days later, we made another day trip to Slide rock again. On the way we went to Montezuimas Castle and meteor crater (pretty cool but not worth the $38 for 2 adults and 2 chilldren over 2). I would recommend this adventure for families who enjoy something different. We used frequent flier miles for three airline tickets and Hilton honours points for the hotel stay.

A few items would have helped -- like a toaster and maybe a kitchen trash can that could hold more than a cereal box. It would have been nice if the pools had been open a little later than 8 on such hot nights though, and the little pools around the casitas were mobbed, and hot and felt oily. It was nice to have laundry facilities right near the rooms, and the shops were convenient for buying small items. The fitness center was well equipped but the employees were so snooty toward the paying hotel guests that they made us feel very unwelcome. Apparently it is a fitness club for local residents too.Were not terribly fussy, but I think that the rooms could be updated and a little cleaner. The pools also showed signs of wear (chipping tiles) all around the shallow end. On one hot afternoon the whole pool had to be closed (for the night)because a child had gone to the bathroom, so that was a huge disappointment.

I was disappointed when I did not see a luggage rack. The waste basket in the powder room had a very narrow opening and in my opinion, wasnt very effective.We stayed in the north building adjacent to the pool area and a couple of the restarants and shopping. However, I felt like the map of the campus was really not to scale since we had to drive all over looking for the Spa and Salon the following morning and hoping we werent late to out appointment. The building for the Spa and Salon was not signed very well and with the construction going on it was difficult to manuever around the campus.The Spa and Salon was a treat and the staff was very welcoming and made both myself and my sister feel well taken care of and pampered. The Cranberry/Apple ice tea they offered us was delicious.Since I prepaid through Hotels.com and just posted a credit card for incidentals, check out was a breeze however I was disappointed that I wasnt asked how the room was, how are stay was or anything. I also had to report that on the morning of check out, we found ants in the room. The agent made note but didnt seem too concerned nor did she offer apologies.I also didnt notice until I returned home to Las Vegas that evening that I had 4 bites on my foot and ankle.

The air conditioner was noisy (were not used to air conditioning) but we had no problem sleeping. We could not hear any noise from the adjoining units, and the resort itself was quiet at night. My only complaint, and its a minor one, pertains to my observation that many people at the pool were not staying at the hotel. According to my Phoenix friends, resort-crashing is common, but the result was that during the hottest part of the day, the pool was almost unbearably crowded. As a corollary, I had a very tough time finding a place to sit by the pool, as towels covered all the lounges. I was not swimming, just wanting to watch my son, and most of the time I sat on the edge of the pool because all the chairs were reserved--even though no one ever came to sit in them. It was annoying, and since the pool management doesnt seem to care about this practice, my advice to anyone planning to stay at the PHSPR is to show up when the pool opens and place towels on at least twice as many chairs as you think you might need.

Do not be fooled by the fantastic pictures in the holiday booksof the pool. looks fantastic but it was FREEZING cold as was the river ranch(though that was heated by the third day)We always phone any hotel prior to booking as we have a disabled child that can not go into cold water ,we were assured that the pool was heated ALL year round.to 78/82 After complaining as did other guests, we were told so many differentexcuses too many to say but all were rubbish.In the end the pool stayed friged and unusable for the full 18 nights.no one could use the pool. we tried to complain every day nothing was ever done.Also out of all the hot tubs NONE were working, some had no lights around them working, the bubbles did not work and some were also cold. the tiles were chipped and hanging off. which meant sharp edgesOur chill out time to sit in one with a glass of wine when the kids were in bed..did not happen. when we tried to compain we were told that it would be rectified but in the mean time we were told to walk from our room accross a very large dark car park through the lobby and try the one there!! The lights did not work!! nor did the bubbles. They did manage to heat one but that was all, no lights and when we put the bubbles on it emptied the hot tub.The ranch staff....(except Little old Lil) rude abrupt slack sevice, the food was at best a fast food cafe, As we have stayed in the US somany times were very well accustomed to the tipping culture. We always tip, what we do not like nor appreciate is being told that the bill does not cover their gratuity/tip while we were still in themiddle of our meal. on many different occaisons the order was wrong, we did not get cutlery, the drink was sloshed over the table as it was slammed down, our daughters we not even spoken to nor was there any pleasant banter.

This is a very good resort for families - esp. those with young children. We have a 4 year old and a 7 year old and they really loved the Resort. They (and we) think the best part is the Coyote Camp - the childrens program. The Camp is very profesionally run and every day offers different activities centered on Arizona and its culture. I feel like my kids actually LEARNED something plus they made new friends. The Resort was fully booked during our stay and while it was crowded; rarely was it so crowded that it affected our enjoyment. A lot of days however, the kids preferred going to the smaller pool outside of our suite. I did expect the River Ranch to be bigger than it was. The lazy river is long and winding, but the main pool is really NOT that big. As for the restaurants at the property, they need to get their act together a little better at the Hole in the Wall ranch. We went there several times, and they could never get our order right. It was worth an evening dessert stop for the Smores. For a very similar price and 200% better service and food, go to the Lantana Grille instead. Much more varied menu at the Lantana Grill - everything from sandwiches to gourmet entrees. Poolside service ran from mediocre to poor... again lack of experience on the servers part. Several times my husband would order something and when the bill came the item was $1 to $2 more expensive; they would tell us we were looking at old menus.The resort was cleaner and more up to date than I expected but then again I had low expectations after reading this website.

When you checked in you were given a wrist band and plenty of towels. We went down early both mornings and got a spot by the upper pool with the basketball net. People were reserving chairs but I always saw available chairs around.We enjoyed two great days at the pool. My children ages 8 10 met a lot of other children and enjoyed all of the activities they had going on. Some examples of the activities are: water balloon toss, water slide races, musical chairs and a watermelon eating contest just to name a few. I am not sure if they always have so many activities going on or if it is because it was the week before Easter (spring break) but my kids had a blast participating in them. Also, the college age guys/girls running the activities were super nice!! Winners even won prizes which were tickets for free smoothies at the snack bar. This was a good deal because if you paid for them they were $5 In the back of the gift shop there is a candy counter/icecream shop. Get your sodas there... a lot less expensive and a lot bigger.We ate lunch both days by the pool ordering from the snack/pool bar. The food was expensive and pretty good. We know what resort prices are and were not surprised. Unfortunately we did not get to eat at Hole in the Wall restaurant (my daughter became sick on the trip) We did order pizza from Streets of New York which delivered to the resort and was excellent. The day we left we had lunch at Aunt Chilads which is in walking distance and is VERY good mexican.We thought the rooms were very clean and well furnished. The beds were very comfortable. We did not have any noise issues.

Plenty of room and privacy for two adults and two 14-year-olds. Its a perfect resort for those with children or teens because there are so many pools and activities, especially the golf. I was worried that we should have gone to the Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs, but after a visit there for lunch we all agreed that Squaw Peak was superior for our needs.The food is a bit pricey, but thats typical of a resort.

We had a very nice room with a day room and a bedroom and a balcony. We had direct access to the cliffs right off of our floor. Room was very clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. The ground are very nice and spread out. There are shuttles that can take you all over the resort if you do not want to walk. There are two main pools in the main hotel a family pool and a adult pool. The adult pool was very nice and quiet. The family pool looked nice and there was a lot for the kids to do including a water slide. There are also a number of smaller pools all over the resort.

We did request a refrigerator and crib (pack n play is what is supplied) and both were in our room within 10 minutes of our arrival, and at no extra charge.

When I booked this reservation through a phone number listed on the hotel website, I SPECIFICALLY asked the reservationist to check the Ranch pool hours because we were arriving late, and would only book this hotel if the Ranch would be open for a couple hours after we arrived. Was told that it would be open until 7:00 pm. When we arrived at 4:00 pm, I asked the bellman to verify the Ranch hours, he also said it would be open until 7:00 pm. Well guess what? After rushing to check in, rushing to our room to change, running to the Ranch using a map that the bellman gave us so we wouldnt get lost on this vast property, the RANCH WAS CLOSED!! We were very disappointed (especially my 12 year old son whom I booked this for). I complained to the front desk manager, who told me that the Hilton is not responsible for the information that is given by the reservation agents since they are not on site!!! When I asked about the bellmans lack of correct information, the manager said that he would talk to him. What a joke!! Besides the issue with the Ranch, this facility is very old and is in serious need of updating. The regular pool area with the swim up bar (which we went to after we could not get into the Ranch) was cold; the jacuzzi jets did not work and the jacuzzi water was colder than the pool; and the pool attendant did not speak English and was unwilling to find someone to help us. Also, there were numerous breakfast trays sitting on the walkways that led to our room; and there is a huge gap between the walkways and the stair railings which could be extremely dangerous for a young child. On a positive note, the inside of the room was updated, clean and a good size. Everything in the room was operational and well maintained. The beds, though, were too soft for my liking. Be sure to ask for the newly renovated area when booking ( I would hate to see the unrenovated rooms)!All in all, a very disappointing experience at the Hilton. We will not book this hotel again.

Since we had our teenage son with us we decided to stay here because of the water park. The water park is indeed great and makes staying here worthwhile when everything is working which is not always the case. Like all Hilton properties in AZ the service here is poor. I had to call the manger one day to get the water slide turned on. Except for the concierge do not expect much service here. Based on my reading of this site I insisted on a renovated room. You should do the same. Our suite was spacious and spotless and gave us 2 separate rooms with 2 TVs to make everyone happy. The location in North Phoenix is a drawback and not a plus. Scottsdale 30 minutes away has much more to offer. The place could use a face lift. Stay here if the rate is good and you have kids. The kids will have a good tiime and then you will too.

The reason for my trip was the annual getaway with the girlfriends.Upon arrival, I was checked in promptly and driven by golf cart to my casita. The property is expansive and a huge plus is the willingness of the bell staff to show up w/ a golf cart to transport guests from place to place. In fact, I arrived in Phoenix in the a.m. and my friends, who rented the car, didnt join me until later in the day. The bell staff actually drove me by van to the local Walgreens and drove me back when I completed my shopping.I will say that my original casita was a bit shabby...carpet worn and frayed, smelled musty and there was no dresser or proper closet in the bedroom. I had booked the casita based on the hotels in-house reservation agents description and it never occured to me to ask, is there a dresser and a traditional closet in the bedroom? I immediately called the front desk and I must say that the manager was MOST ACCOMODATING and not only changed my casita to a much nicer location, but offered an upgrade of an additional adjoining bedroom. Suffice it to say, the three of us were most comfortable during our stay w/ the two bedrooms. I found out later that the casitas are due for renovation next month (April 07). Im glad I brought to the managers attention the shabbiness of the first casita, especially because we were paying seasonal rates. It was nice reflection on the property that the manager did the right thing to accomodate guests.The property was beautiful and very well maintained. It was a bit cold to swim but the water park is great and I would highly recommend this property for vacationing families, singles and business travelers. There is a Convention Center attached and the property was filled to capacity, but one never had the perception that it was packed due to the fact that the property is so spread out. The onsite restaurants (only two) are well-staffed and the food is very good which is just below great. The room service crew erred quite a few times during our stay which was disappointing but they always strived to correct the problem. Also a DVD player was delivered w/o the remote, so a new one was delivered the next day and there was no charge. Although mistakes were made (shabby first room, room service omissions, DVD player w/o remote), EVERY EFFORT was made to correct the problem so as to make the customer happy. A final comment is the workout/spa facilities. The workout room is fantastic and has long hours of operation. The spa has very delightful technicians and the services were all quite satisfactory but it is definitely NOT A SPA. It is a beauty parlor w/ a few private rooms and a few showers. There is one chaise lounge in the ladies room that faces a wall and a dusty silk plant. In my opinion, any facility that calls itself a spa should at least have a relaxation room w/ a few sofas or lounge chairs. Again, the technicians delivered their services beautifully, but for the prices charged, this customer wants to bask in a true spa atmosphere before, during and after treatment!!I would recommend staying here, but dont expect a top notch, well-appointed room or spa even if you are paying $300+ per night. All employees and managers were exceptionally friendly and helpful (except one front desk clerk who asked, what do you want me to do? when we called because there was no remote w/ our dvd player)!I will consider staying here again as it is conveniently located near the airport, highways, restaurants and shopping, yet it feels a bit secluded due to the beautiful terrain and mountainous backdrop.

The downstairs had a dining table, 2 sofas, t.v., wet bar and small refrigerator with 1/2 bath. Upstairs is the main bedroom with full bath and bed. The decor in the casitas was a bit run down, with really old burgundy carpet, very outdated bathroom fixtures, and furniture in desperate need of reupholstering. I think with some simple remodeling updates, this could be a first-rate property. One of our casitas had a nice large balcony off the main bedroom, while the other had a huge sundeck right off the second floor. The sundeck had a full sized table with 4 chairs and an umbrella and 2 lounge chairs! Awesome for soaking in the Arizona sun. One casita overlooked a private pool, which was so much fun to step right outside and hit the water. This is a super resort for kids! The main swimming pool area is amazing!

I could even let them wander off and do it together without supervision. Thats a huge plus. The Coyote Club was very, very good. A really nice, large facility with clearly devoted staff and fun art projects and other endeavors (including a hunt for arrowheads that the staff had taken the time to scatter in the mountainous hills ahead of time). A couple recommendations if you go: be aware that the casitas, while two floors, have no doors at all closing the upstairs from the downstairs. So if you want to have any private time with your spouse, your kids will be well within earshot. I think I might have preferred to have stayed in a large room in the main hotel for this reason. I read another review about lackluster maintenance here and we had a problem with a clogged heating filter that banged all night long when our neighbors heat/AC ran (every 10 minutes). But, to the Hiltons credit, they were very apologetic and made the appropriate compensation to us when I reported it. What else? I had a superb tennis lesson from Paul Dean, the tennis pro. The Saturday yoga class was also good. The spa services we had were good, but not excellent. If you really like spa treatments, I would recommend driving to one of the more upscale resorts (the Biltmore or the Phoenician) for those.

My four-year-old had a ball with his cousins on the Lazy River, which was an excellent experience and really was as much fun as the pictures appear. He also enjoyed the waterslide and the mini-golf. And cant say enough about the Hole In the Wall restaurant which has been favorably reviewed on here. No bargains pricewise for the food but everything our family ate was tasty. We also enjoyed the outdoor fire and introducing our son to SMores.What won me over with this place is that they didnt nickle and dime guests. They didnt charge extra for mini-golf. They didnt even mention any sort of extra charge when 3 cousins and their mom and dad showed up to use the pool. There wasnt a separate resort fee. And they didnt charge for parking.Couples wont be disappointed by this resort but I dont want to hear people complaining about the large number of kids in the pools and hot tubs!

The service and food were both excellent. The setting is great, overlooking the main pool and waterfall. At night, they have a gas outdoor firepit for roasting marshmellows or enjoying the desert evenings. They serve warm fry bread with meals, which I can only describe as tasting like a light, flat doughnut ... excellent and unique.The pools were great and very relaxing.

The only difference was the Hilton beds (which were very comfortable) and the new tile on the bathroom floor. Our chair was ripped, old furniture, old carpeting, they even took out the refridgerators and left an empty hole. We did call maintenance and they managed to find an old one and had to sit on top of the sink - my sister never got hers. You call this a remodel?! The bathroom sink is very small - no room for your toiletries and they put a large TV on one of the shelves so you have no room to put your stuff. They have 3 small drawers. The pool/lazy river though is wonderful. They have very pretty landscaping and clean grounds. Poor quality food at the pool bar - $9.25 for a small hamburger and bag of chips.

Each room comes with its own covered parking space.These are probably some of the best rooms we have stayed in - big, comfortable, airy and with lots of amenties. No wireless internet access unfortunately. The resort has plenty of pools and spas with a lazy river running through and around it.

We ended up choosing this resort thanks to the reviews on tripadvisor.com and were NOT disappointed! My girlfriend and I stayed in this fine resort for 4 days in early Oct. We found most of the reviews to be very true and accurate. Rather than sharing useless details about our stay, I will instead provide you with suggestions on how you can enjoy your stay to the fullest!. Hopefully these suggestions will make your trip as successful as ours. #1 - Request a remodeled room upon making your reservation. The remodeled rooms contain new everything! Our room was AWESOME! We checked out some rooms that had not yet been remodeled, at the same price, and were so thankful that we had made this request (thanks to other reviews on tripadvisor.com). #2 - Request a fridge upon checking in. This cost us nothing and proved so nice to have. #3 - Take advantage of the free shuttle system. Upon request, the bell desk granted us free shuttles to the Fashion mall and the Squaw Peak Summit. They were EXTREMELY courteous and very informative. Assuming you are at all adventurous and enjoy the outdoors, I cannot say enough good things about the Squaw Peak Summit climb. 1.5 miles, 1200 feet up, and so very very beautiful! The other climbers are VERY friendly and the view is to die for. Be sure to bring your camera and plenty of water! #4 - Eat at Hole In The Wall! The food is fantastic, VERY reasonable, and the service is professional and timely. We ate there each day. Dominic was our waiter and VERY friendly! #5 - Take advantage of the concierge. We knew very little about the area that we were in along with the attractions that were nearby. They are VERY helpful and will provide you with an array of attractions, availability, prices, recommendations, etc. #6 - Lastly - plan on making a trip to the Walgreens or any local grocery store on the first day. The water in the room is a complete rip off ($6 a bottle) and the drinks at the pool ($9 for a weak mixed drink) were about the only negatives that we could come up with. After the first day we stocked up on water and bought some liquor at the grocery store in order to make this trip more affordable and enjoyable. I would/have HIGHLY recommend this resort too all of my friends and family. I simply hope that you enjoy your trip just as much as we enjoyed ours!

We stayed for five days and were able to get a complimentary upgrade (w/our Hilton rewards points) to a one bedroom (2 story) casita, which is perfect for families with 2 or more children. The River Ranch is wonderful for kids and adults alike.....the slower paced lazy river is for those that just want to float in inner tubes and the waterslide is for the kids or adults that want to go faster. This time of year is usually hotter in AZ, thus the water park is even more relaxing. They have an extremely accomodating staff, very friendly and helpful, we just had to watch that our bill was accurate (quite a bit of accidental over-charges). The Hole in the Wall restaurant is great. My kids love ordering the rattlesnake ($18) dinner and you can roast smores right at your table ($10). I recommend their Arizona style bloody marys to drink, served with olives, pepperocinis. and extra spice...very tasty. We took the free shuttle service up to their sister resort (Tapatio Cliffs) about 10-15 min up the mtn, and enjoyed the pools there one day. Tapatio Cliffs seemed a bit more upscale than Squaw Peak..much more adult only pools, nice cushions on the pool chairs, etc., but my kids and I had fun swimming and relaxing by their lagoon style pools as well. They also have an enclosed water slide at the cliffs .....both places are nice resorts, and its convenient to be be able to shuttle between them. Coyote Camp is a great place to drop off your kids for desert- themed arts/crafts/activities, etc (ages 5-12 yrs) and it costs about $10 per hr per child.....worth it in my opinion. My daughter, now 10 yrs, has been going to Coyote Camp 3 yrs in a row , and this one of her favorite things to do at the resort. The staff at Coyote Camp is always warm, welcoming and accomodating to my kids and some of the staff have been there 15 years. They love what they do.We also visited the Phoenix Science Center in downtown Phoenix and stayed 3-4 hours.....I highly recommend it....we ate a lite lunch at the Victorian Tea House, next door to the Science Center afterwards..and that also is a good place to eat, they even have a childrens menu.You can spend some $$ is you order poolside, each non-alcoholic drink is $2.50 for soda/tea and you pay by the glass/cup...for instance, each time I wanted a glass of iced tea, I paid for it, no free refills, so that can definitely add up, but it is convenient to sit by the pool and have someone bring you drinks/food, etc.Otherwise, great trip all around, and summer is the best time to go, because the rates are so cheap...we definitely recommend the Hilton Squaw Peak or Tapatio Cliffs to anyone, especially families.

Nowehere on the website does it indicaqte that the property is undergoing major renovations, but it is. We traveled with 4 other families. Two of the rooms had air conditioner problems, requiring a move. The moves took at least an hour to accomplish, and, one move required the guests to move their own luggage, as the bellman refused to move the bags, after being asked not to drag the ladies dress on the ground. We were told that the bell station moves about 40 rooms a day due to the construction, and problems with the rooms. Half the hotel is closed, for construction, leaving only two ice machines an entire wing. This meant that there was hardly any ice ever available. The elevator broke during our stay. Since there was only one elevator in the south wing, if you wanted to get to and from your room, you had to walk.The pool is very nice, and the kids enjoyed it.

The mini bar was stocked with high priced items which we did not purchase. We went to the River Ranch each day which I thought was very crowded and busy.

We did spend some time at the hotel pool/jacuzzi which was nice and quiet. You had to get to the River Ranch early to reserve a chair or else you were out of luck. They did not allow outside food or coolers. They did have water coolers with cups available and they had a bar crew which would take your food and/or drink orders and deliver them to you. The grounds are well kept and are very attractive. We ate at Hole in the Wall twice. Once for lunch and once for dinner. The lunch was very good and dinner was ok.

Resort was available and inexpensive as we needed a place to stay before moving into another resort in Scottsdale.Resort located in midst of city, surrounded by heavy traffic roads, etc, though we could not hear any road noise due to the landscaping and how the rooms faced inward to a pool area. Room had a separate two queen bed bedroom, TV, bureau, credenza and closet - no security safe though. Odd shape of room led to the use of a pocket door instead of a regular door, plus one bed partially blocked the door exit. Otherwise, the bedroom was fine. Patio which was a sliding door off the bedroom looked out into the pool and the neighboring hallway. Just enough room for two chairs - useful only to dry your swim suit. Bathroom split with toilet, tub/shower in one room and sink/countertop in an open area next to the bedroom. Living room had a sofa, chair, chair/desk, TV stand, mini-bar fridge/counter with coffee maker. Minibar was stocked with usual minibar overpriced drinks/snacks. We asked for a refrigerator and microwave which was delivered later in the day. Furniture looked fine, but the carpet was a bit dated. Room was fine, though worn.Parking was far from the room and no easy path to get the luggage to the room. Initial day the elevator was broken, requiring lugging everything to the second floor by hand. By 2nd day, elevator was functional. Grounds were well maintained and manicured greenery.Best asset of the Pointe was the water park (passes for each hotel guest) and the quieter smaller pools in two of the hotel complexes. Hotel pools were well maintained, plenty of towels, chairs, cleaned pool, kiddie pool, whirlpool, chilled water cooler/cups. Water park was typical - lazy river, sports pool - volleyball, regular pool with water falls. Too busy for our needs, so we visited only once to see what was offered. Adjacent grill provided food. Food was typical grill food with childrens menu. Room service was offered, though we did not partake.All, in all the stay was slightly above average. Did not see any cockroaches or other bugs. Place was clean, though a bit dated and worn. Hotel lobby was cheerful, staff friendly and helpful. Place was trying hard to make people happy. Would stay again. Price was great.

If you are looking for a clean and spacious hotel that is conveniently located,and you enjoy a family friendly environment with exceptional service, this hotel may be for you. Although lacking the initial wow factor that I expected, I thought that The Hilton provided amazing service. The concierge was friendly and extremely helpful, our room was always clean, the pool attendants were very welcoming, and room service was quick and delicious. With any hotel, there were a few things that I wished were a bit different. The sitting room was dark, even with all three lamps on, the air conditioning was a little loud and the sink/mirror were separate from the shower/toilet. The light switch to the bathroom was located outside of the bathroom door. So, for those of you traveling with practical jokers, they will have a great time at your expense! Nothing earth shattering, just food for thought. Now, back to the fun stuff...the hotel offers many different pools to accomodate people of all ages, and they even had a movie night! Our courtyard pool closed earlier than posted, so you may want to check the hours. The hotel is conveniently located for sight seeing. Take time to drive around and look at the mountains, they are gorgeous! Scottsdale/Phoenix has wonderful restaurants . NY pizza delivers to the hotel and was fast and delicious, Charlestons and Black Angus are casual but very nice, and have wonderful food and excellent service. Bahama Breeze has good food in a fun environment, and also had outstanding service. Kierland Commons and Desert Ridge shopping centers offer fun shopping, and are nice areas even if you are only window shopping. Plenty of antique shops and golfing opportunities abound. Antique shoppers traveling with families beware: there is one town in particular that is well known for its antique shops. They have a beautiful brochure, which is extremely misleading. Once you see the gang graffiti, turn around, it does not get much better. It is obvious that the town is trying to clean things up, because the actual downtown area is being renovated and looks quite lovely. The surrounding area...not so lovely, and it isnt worth the risk. Although I feel a little guilty for indirectly ratting them out, I feel a deeper loyalty to innocent families who may get into harms way. Dont miss the Desert Botanical Garden, which is beautiful and very peaceful. There are also plenty of little squirrels and quail to amuse everyone. Crackerjax offers miniature golfing, go-carts and an arcade. Although not entirely perfect, the Hilton offers a comfortable environment for the whole family, and near-perfect service. They have great rates right now, so I would definetely give them a try.

Upon check in we were not greeted just checked in. We were given a key and led to the appropriate parking lot for our building and pointed in the direction of our room. We carried our own luggage down a dark hallway to the last room. The room was ok but not worth the price we paid. The smoke detector was hanging from the wall with wires hanging from the wall, we were not sure if it worked or not?? With that said we quickly changed and headed to the pool. It took us a good 10 minutes to find the pool. Once we found it we noticed 3 families leaving the ares with their children. A few minutes later I realized why they were leaving. There were 3 young adults clearly drunk and acting very loud and obnoxious. They were drinking and some very inappropriate behavior between the famale and male was happening in the jacuzzi area. I told my kids to stay at our end of the pool since they really wanted to swim. A few minutes later the young males climed on top of the pool bars roof and started jumping into the pool. I finally decided to call the front desk and was assurred they would send security. 10 minutes later I called again because no security personnel ever came to the pool area. Another 10 minutes and 6 security personnel officers arrived. The young adults were bad mouthing the security and refusing to get out of the pool. It turns out that they were not even guests at the hotel. A little later 2 of the families that left earlier returned with their kids to swim in the pool. Where were those security officers and why were they not wlking the grounds. The next morning we left the grounds to have breakfast in town not realizing that the hotel offered children eat free with the purchase of an adults meal. Thats because we were not told anything upon check in, no information about the hotel, no information about the specials, and no map or information about their Hole in the Wall water park. I complained about all of the above to Guest Relations and was told I would hear from the General Manager of the Hotel. I only received a call from the Head of Security explaining that the young adults were escorted off the hotel grounds, which was information I already knew. That was the only response I received and the only issue I addressed. I called the Guest Relations again to inform them that I had not heard a response from the Hotels General Manager and was told that I received a call from the Head of Security addressing my concerns. I told Customer Relations this was not true and filed another complaint. Which led to our discounted stay on June 28, which was just as bad.We were offered a 50% discount to stay again. We were given a room facing the courtyard, seemed nice and as if they were attempting to make up for the bad service we previously experienced. We went to the pool and enjoyed a nice quiet time until we got into the ice cold jacuzzi and no one to help fix it. We went back to our room to take showers and questioned if the bathroom/room had been cleaned or cleaned and then used??? The bathroom had a used towel hanging on the back of the door and hair on the floor and in the shower on the tub and shower curtain. I was so angry at this point I just wanted to leave but it was 11:30. We got ready for bed and as my daughter pulled down the sheets to her bed she discovered hair strands between her sheets....she almost threw up and was on the verge of tears because she didnt want to sleep in it. The next morning I decided to take the kids to the Hole in the Wall Water Park attached to the hotel and discovered the mail pool was closed. After an hour or so I walked down to see if it was open. I saw bugs floating in the pool. These were roach type bugs that were huge. They were so big I had to ask if they were real or a childs toy. They were real. There were grounds keepers and maintance workers running around all morning so I didnt know what was going on. Now I know there are bugs everywhere but if they had sprayed I think they should of opened later or scooped the bugs out of the pool right away. I was scared to let my children in the pool because I didnt know if there was chemicals in there or what. The bugs were also floating in the lazy river......YUK! At this point I just wanted to run as fast as I could from this place. The water park staff was rude and no one there was helpful. I again called the Guest Relations to complain and was told that I would hear from the General Manager of the hotel. As of today July 4, I have not heard a word from anyone. I would stay as far away from this hotel as possible. You could get better service from any other hotel in the area for far less money.

The one-bedroom suite was very clean and the bedding was exceptional. Probably the best nights sleep I have ever had while staying in a hotel. We ate two breakfasts on site at the Slim Pickens Restaurant. The first was a breakfast buffet on Sunday and it was exceptional. All you can eat for 9.99. Service was excellent. The second time we ate was during the week and breakfast cost more and was not very good. Service was not acceptable. We thought that our young waiter had quit during our meal.The propery was very well kept. The only problem was the pool area where we were located. Each area has its own pool. During the first few days of our stay, the pool was in disarray every morning. Towels were not picked up and food and beverage containers were still everywhere from the night before. About Wednesday, things changed and the pool area was spotless. Possibly the person in charge of the pool was on vacation at the beginning of the week. Another problem with the pool was a private company giving swimming lessons to small children. After a day of being in conferences, it would have been nice to just get into the pool, but that wasnt always possible. Last, there are no pool rules posted and children were throwing balls, diving into the pool (there was a no diving sign), and many just being obnoxious. No real parenting going on there. The same could be said for the Lazy River. Luckily I wasnt there for a relaxing vacation.While I would consider staying there again because the rooms and staff were so nice, probably I would look for another place.

We have custody of our 7 year old grandson and we found Squaw Peak on the Hilton website. We wanted a fun place to take him and this looked like it was it. After booking, I became concerned after reading some of the TripAdvisor reviews. Having stayed in a number of Hilton properties, I can tell you that if you have children, this is the place to go. The River Ranch has multiple pools, a long lazy river for use with pool-supplied inner tubes, a water slide, and a kiddie pool. Neat waterfall for kids and adults to play in. There is also a hot tub at the River Ranch. Food at the River Ranch outdoor bar is the same price as any pool resort-a little pricey, but not outrageuos. But there are plenty of water stations at the pool with large containers of free cold water and plenty of cups along side. The only aspect that bothered me is that through the week, it closed at 8 pm. I thought that too early-especially with the temp hitting 112 degrees...The Hole in the Wall restaurant at the River Ranch was good and the prices were very reasonable. We did not play the miniature golf only because it was too hot, but it looked fun. We stayed in a regular suite with 2 queen beds, and it was fine. Very comfortable bed. No, you could not put personal items in the fridge, but we bought a styro cooler down the street at Walgreens and kept it filled with ice from the ice machines located on every floor.If you are eating outside the resort, you will need a car. You can walk to Aunt Chiladas (good Mexican food-neat atmosphere- very reasonable prices-good margaritas -you can purchase your own shaker to take home!) Other than that, you will need to drive. Good choices are Claim Jumper (good prices- kid friendly-neat menu choices-to die for 6 layer chocolate cake..it is a 10 dollar dessert, but feeds a host of people!) Another fun place to take kids is the 5  Diner. (Juke box at every table, milk shakes served in the stainless shakers-terrific food real really reasonably priced..) Pizza was good and inexpensive at Streets of New York. We were only there for 4 days, so we did not go on any tours or day trips. But our grandson enjoyed the pools so much that it did not matter to us that we did not go anywhere else. After the pool closed at 8 pm, he could swim in our south-end pool complex. I thought the water was cloudy in the hotel complex pool, but he enjoyed it anyway. I was looking forward to using the hotel complex hot tub after the River Ranch closed, but the first night, it was ice cold! It was warm the remaining nights, though...We did check out the Hilton Tapatio Resort also in Phoenix. Again, if you have kids or are an adult that likes water play, stick to Squaw Peak! I did think the pricing for the Squaw Peak kids Coyote Camp was too high. But since our grandson was perfectly happy making friends in the River Ranch water area, we did not use the Camp. The River Ranch is open later on Fri and Sat nights-they show an outdoor kids movie on Sat nights. The kids can swim and watch a movie at the same time-that was kinda cool...It did bother me that there were no safes in the rooms-that needs attention!! And a 10 dollar a day charge for internet service was ridiculous-I would not and did not pay for that-even thought I took my wireless laptop with me. Sorry, but that should be free!!! The staff was friendly and they all took a few moments and chatted with our grandson whenever he wanted to show them his latest purchase from a gift shop or needed scotch tape or glue for something he was working on..(Much appreciated, staff!) And the lady at the 3rd floor kids concierge played a board game with him one hot afternoon-thanks! And the hotel concierge in the lobby really knew the area and what to recommend. He printed a map for us one night when we asked directions for an eatery. And they will print your boarding passes for you the day before you leave-that was a great help to us!I do think they need more handicapped parking. My husband requires handicapped parking, and it was always hard to find one available-especially during the weekend. But all in all, we had a really fun time just swimming, exploring the resort complex, trying out new restaurants-just spending some quality family time together. It was very relaxing and my grandson is ready to go again next year. Ditto for my husband and I !!

Ive indicated Pro and Cons below:Pro:1) Great pool(s)! - The North  South buildings all had their own pools, with hot tubs  bars. The River Ranch was huge, with multiple tiered pools. The River, although slow, was very nice and pretty long. You basically ride a large inner-tube. The pool area is great for families with kids.2) General service - I thought the service was great, very helpful. 3) Nice rooms - The rooms were nice, not very upscaled. We stayed in the regular 1-bedroom suites, so I cant speak about the bigger units or Casitas.4) Easy check in/out. Be aware of the 4pm check-in though.5) Room service (meals) were good.Cons:1) Construction work on our floor....changing out locks. Not too much of an inconvenience, but a bit of a hassle getting new keys. The resort is starting to show alittle wear  tear, hence the need for constant fixes.2) Maid service had to be reminded to make-up rooms.3) The resort is a bit expensive for a Hilton, but many discounts (i.e. AAA, Entertainment) exist.4) This is a great family resort, however, given that my group had no kids tagging along, we got alittle tired of all little ones running around. If thats a problem, go elsewhere.Things to do:1) Sedona was a great day trip. Ill certainly make another trip there someday.2) Golfing - we played at the Sanctuary and the Arizona Biltmore. Both great courses! The Sanctuary is a VERY tight desert course, while the Biltmore is a traditional course. The temperture was brutal however, about 105 degrees!

I typically to do a lot of research before we go on vacation, because elements of a vacation--like the quality of the hotel--can make or break the entire trip. I must admit that I was a bit nervous about reserving a room at the Squaw Peak Resort because there were some mixed on-line reviews. Some people reported poorly lit rooms. Others said the property was dated. One review said that it had those kind of people, though Im not exactly sure what that meant.So, here is the scoop...This place is not a Four Seasons, nor is it the Phoenician. It, however, does not charge 5-Star resort rates either--we paid $161/night AAA rate for a true suite with a separate bedroom. With respect to quality of the accomodations, the Squaw Peak Resort is in line with an Embassy Suites hotel. The hotel caters to both conventioniers and famlies. This diversity is made possible because the hotels River Ranch water park area (a very nice family-oriented swimming pool(s) recreation area) is separated from the hotel buldings by the parkng lot. For the most part, this separation keeps the families away from the business people, who have their own, less ornate pools in their respective hotel wings. Overall, the grounds are very pleasant, and the River Ranch area is very nice. The Lazy River, which is a swimming pool that allows you to float in an innertube around the property, is fun and highly relaxing. The photos I have seen of the Lazy River really dont do it justice as it is pretty expansive and the scenery is diverse too.The food in the pool area is solid and the service at The Hole In The Wall Restaurant borders on excellent. As a matter of fact, everyone at the hotel is very friendly and courteous. The hotel also has a great work-out area (available to guests for a small fee)--much better than the standard hotel gym--with an extensive weight room and a separate aerobics room. I did not try any services at the adjacent spa, but that looked decent too. Like all things in life, there are things to complain about. I noticed the first few days that a lot of the inevitable litter (drink cups, etc.) that people leave around the multiple swimming pools didnt get cleaned up by the hotel staff--This was epecially true of the Lazy River, where the same crushed can of beer lingered for days on a wall around one of the bends.A small complaint is that the hotel is not walking distance to anything in particular. As a result, you really need a car if you want a change of scenary. It is about a 15-25 minute drive to Scottsdale which has great shopping, dining, and people watching. The second item isnt so much a complaint as it is a concern...What would this place be like during spring break? We went during the low season, when most kids are in school, so the resort wasnt very crowded. But, the staff told me that during spring break, and during the summer when highly discounted rates are available, that the place is really hopping. The River Ranch is big, but not that big, so ones stay would probably be a lot less relaxing during those times. My bigger wonder, however, has to do with drinking age kids, as I could see a mix of college kids and little kids would be poor in a place that serves alcohol pool-side. Overall, the Squaw Peak Resort offers a great family value for the dollar. My six year-old thought it was on par with Maui and Disneyland as a vacation destination--pretty high praise.

She had a great time. Here are the positives and negatives. Every person we encountered at the hotel was friendly. The rooms we average. They are not the nicest Hilton rooms, but the are great for a family. We stayed in the North building in a 1 bdrm suite. It was nice to shut the doors and watch tv while kids slept. There is only one sink, but there is a dressing area in the bedrooom. The price is actually good. We have relatives that paid the same at a basic Best Western and they didnt have near the pool areas that we had. We had a great pool right by our room and when we wanted a change we wandered off to the River ranch, something my children enjoyed thouroghly. The food at the hole-in-the-wall for breakfast was good. The dinner a bit pricey and only average. I suggest you rent a car and try some of the other restaurants that Phoenix has to offer. If you dont have a Cracker Barrel restaurant where you are from search one out while here. They are the best. Also Aunt Chiladas is just O.K. If you come from an area with good Mexican food you will not enjoy this restaurants version. Try to eat at Macayos. Much better. All in All this is a good hotel for the price with better customer service then we have encountered in many of the high end resorts we have stayed at.

Our family has stayed at this hotel numerous times, the last being in July of 2005. After staying at many hotels in the Phoenix area, this has to be the best so far for us. Oh, Im not comparing it to the Biltmore for heavens sake! And the Scottsdale Princess was for another trip without kids. But we paid rates as high as $200 a night right to $89, depending on the time of year. Either rate, we have never had a greater time than when staying here. I have 2 boys (Ages 7 and 17) and BOTH were entertained on a regular basis. The stay in July ($89 rate) was by far the best so far! The manager, having recd a hysterical call from me the evening before, went over and above any hotel manager ever has. Seems that I had booked incorrectly and had us checking in one day prior to our arrival date. The manager assured me that although I didnt show up, there would be no problem for the following day. When we did arrive the following day, we were led to a townhouse type room. No, I didnt request it. No, I didnt tell them I had stayed with them before. We walked into a 2 story 3 bedroom townhouse suite! Complete with our own deck, 2 bathrooms and a smaller swimming pool in our backyard to be shared with others. What a treat! The staff was friendly, efficient and always ready to help. The maid service was exceptional and the eateries were exactly what we were looking for. No fuss, inexpensive, yet the food was delicious and always served with a smile. The night times were so nice, sitting by the fire just talking til the wee hours. We come to Phoenix at least 4 times a year, sometimes with the kids, sometimes without. Our main reason for visiting the area is because we have very close friends that relocated from NJ to Mesa, AZ. They were so impressed with our digs, they moved in for the weekend.We stayed for 5 nights, with never a dull moment. Water park was a nice starting and ending point for our touring days. And a nice welcome to a plain ol pool on the property. Us adults revelled in the lazy river and even took a few rides on the 15 story slide! (Will not be trying that again, ouch!)

My husband and I also took a short walk from the resort to a park full of trails of different levels of difficulty. You can walk on flat trails around some pretty lofty peaks or you can tackle the peaks and be rewarded with some pretty views. The only real low point came when we bought tickets to the western dinner show on the property. It was HORRIBLE! Both the show and the food at dinner were not worth a fraction of the cost. The food at the Lantana Grill was also below average. Next time, we will probably venture off the property for dinner.

If you are bothered by small children (and their noises) DONT GO TO A FAMILY RESORT THAT BLATANTLY ADVERTISES THAT IT CATERS TO CHILDREN! Stay at the Doubletree at the airport. However, this isnt an over the top Hilton Resort- weve stayed at much nicer. We had a one room King Suite on the 2nd floor, overlooking a pool/courtyard. For $400 a night we were disappointed in the service and amenities but overall the stay was pleasant. The sofa bed in the living room was a queen size sofa bed with a full size sofa bed mattress (in other words, it left about a foot of exposed bed frame). VERY unimpressive, and dangerous for children! The bathroom was not fantastic- it was a bit small, but the living room/bar area were adequate, and the walk behind wet bar was convenient for placing ice/drinks in the sink. The pool/hot tub in our courtyard were great at night. The River Ranch pool-resort area closed every day at 5, which seemed too early. We had room service which was actually quite good (probably some of the best room service food weve ever ordered). We ate at the Lantana Grill 2 mornings in a row- the second morning the staff was incredibly rude and the food absolutely disgusting (the egg white spinach omelette was bathed in oil and slithered onto the plate and served with what I suppose they were trying to pass as sun dried tomatoes). We had breakfast another morning at the Hole in the Wall which was EXCELLENT, the staff was friendly, the atmosphere relaxed, and the food was a million times better than the Lantana Grill. We are Diamond members, we were given free water bottles (the $6 per bottle price they want other guest to pay was a bit shocking) but in order to redeem the water bottles you had to go to the gift shop- no big deal, but leave the water bottles in the room already! Poolside service at the River Ranch was decent. The gift shop was nice and convenient. The staff didnt turn on the Lazy river two days in a row- we finally asked about it and they said they thought it was on. It was finally working for the rest of our stay. The kid pool area was fantastic and the large shallow end in the main pool was even better. It was very quiet and peaceful as we were there during the week. We felt welcomed with our 2 1/2 year old despite some large business gatherings that were also going on. The Coyote Ranch for kids is for older children but they offer a wonderful kiddie concierge with books and toys that you can check out during your stay. Helpful if you dont pack the whole toy chest in your luggage. We plan on going back next month for a few days of R  R (and yes, were brining our child- so STAY FAR AWAY if you hate children!) but we did write a letter about some of the issues. We also booked a casita which I think should be more comfortable.

Warning- the property is large and you may have to take a shuttle around or walk fair distances depending on which room you are in. I really didnt mind walking, but I prefer a smaller property.

Im pretty much in overall agreement with that reviewers comments.The rooms are dark and average (ours smelled so strongly of room freshener it was nauseating). The decor is standard Hilton hotel room; nothing imaginative or interesting. If you came with kids, youd probably appreciate the pools and activities. We dont have kids, and arent really into the Disney-themed plastic decoration (including a fake old western town store front theme). I thought the price of $200 per night was pretty high for what you got.The spa is, in my opinion, very misleadingly described as one of the 10 best in Arizona. I dont know what list they are working with, but I cant imagine that is the case. I booked a $165 massage. The massage itself (by Ron) was quite good. But for that kind of money, theres usually a pretty nice spa experience that goes along with it. In this case, I checked in, and the girl at the counter didnt even offer to take me to a locker room and give me a robe! I had to ask for that. The locker rooms are your regular gym-type locker room. There is a co-ed steam room and sauna. No whirlpool. After I saw a man in the steam room stretching his hamstrings in full workout gear (including gym shoes), I wouldnt have gone in the steam room if you paid me! The showers are badly in need of an overhaul -- mildewed, no water pressure. The waiting room is basically on a sofa in the beauty salon -- strong smell of nail varnish. During the massage, the table rocked throughout (it needed some sort of repair), and everytime water turned on in the hair salon you heard it loudly.One nice place to hike -- the Phoenix Mountain Park (east on Glendale past Highway 51). Great nice hikes -- although you have to drive about 10 minutes to get there.The Aunt Chiladas place was a good place to grab a bite.

We checked in early, had a very nice suite (asked for non-smoking, king, and not first floor and all were accomodated). Also got a $90 (+tax, etc.) per night rate on Pricline so that was a bonus. Pros- nicely kept grounds, friendly staff, great pool. We do not have kids (Im 8 months pregnant actually), but we still enjoyed the place very much as a couple seeking a final pre-kid escape. Our room was quiet, the pool(s) were spacious enough for all comers on a holiday weekend during high season, and our bed was absolutely wonderful. Were not typical resort folk (more the bargain hunting type), so this place was a wonderful treat for us. We also had a rental car- if you didnt you might be limited as theres not much close by except the hotel restaurants and shops.Minor cons- the suite has a nice kitchenette but the small fridge is locked and overstocked with items for charge-- the hotel information says do not store personal items in the fridge due to spoilage concerns or something. Thats a bit ridiculous. We never opened it for fear of excess charges. It would have been nice for us to be able to use the kitchen for easy breakfasts, and keep our own milk and oj and leftovers in the fridge. Also, the remodeled Lantana grill has no atmosphere and is overpriced. Our beef satay appetizers were great but the quesadilla we ordered was horrible. Im glad we didnt order big expensive dinners- a family seated behind us was clearly unhappy with how long it took to get their meals and how they were done.

The water park is great, all the water is heated to the point where you dont feel any chill at all when stepping in. They will give you as many towels as you want. They have a bar/cafe on site and is good for a burger or dog and a beer (they also will deliver food/drinks to your seat). I easily spent all day there. Loved the lazy river, waterslide, and the big waterfall. Tip- you are allowed to bring your own pool toys (as long as theyre not huge). The restaurant had very good food and the staff was very friendly. My waitress was able to keep her cool after being yelled at by some crazy lady with 4 kids that was sitting across from me.

ROOMS: We had a suite of sitting room with sofa sleeper and bedroom with 2 doubles. The first night we were in the south pointe block, very dated rooms with vanity at end of bed in main bedroom and only 4 small drawers for 5 peoples clothes for a weeks stay!!!! The paint was flaking off the woodwork, the room smelled dirty even though it looked clean, and the bathroom was the most basic and I thought the smallest bathroom I have experienced in the USA. We had just spent all day driving so we just shut up and put up. Next morning we got transferred over to the north pointe block to an updated room on the ground floor which I had said was OK but the desk clerk failed to mention that there was a five foot screen blockwall enclosing our tiny patio because it adjoined the car park, the suite was tidier but the bathroom was even smaller than the first, a very short tub but slightly better shower head, thankfully the vanity had its own recess seperate to the bedroom and was pretty with granite countertop and nice fittings. You could only get out one side of the beds as I found out when I got up in the night and crashed into the wall and I am quite petite! There was more clothes storage though. Suites are better suited to a 4 people occupancy than 5, my teenage son was not amused that the maid had walked in 3 times by 8am, he was on the sofa sleeper and waiting to shower, he made sure he used the do not disturb sign after that. Registration told us that they were sorry we had been wrongly advised, we should have booked a casita.FOOD: We were advised to take out the bounceback breakfast package at an extra $20 + tax a night and that kids breakfast was free, our kids ages were on the confirmation slip so reservations knew 2 of them were over the age 12 cut off for kids meals. Bounceback breakfast only costs $8-50 at the table so it is cheaper to pay or charge it at the table on a daily basis than to purchase vouchers in advance, kids breakfast is not included but it is only $4, but our breakfast bill was an extra $15-$20 daily on top of what I had been quoted, we got another Im sorry, you were misinformed. Also check your restaurant bill, ours was wrong 3 days out of 4 and the bounceback breakfast options varied depending on your server despite being written clearly on the menu- we opted to skip breakfast after that as we couldnt face any more meals there or any more Im sorry but you were misinformed comments - the other restaurant was closed. The restrooms in the hole in the wall are labelled squatters and standers which I actually found offensive.RIVER RANCH: The nightly rate only covers 4 people per suite, extra kids are $10 daily, another Im sorry but you were misinformed as I specifically asked if all resort fees were included for all 5 of us when I booked and was told - yes of course.River ranch has a lazy river (it is actually the river that is lazy, it is so slow you have to paddle yourself in order to move). There is 1 flume type slide, a toddlers pool, 2 swimming pools and a very hot spa, which I liked once they cleaned it out but I was the only one in it, others dipped toes, said ouch and walked away as it was so hot. My 5 year old was kept amused for about the same amount of time as in a regular hotel pool, my older kids were not particularly impressed and actually didnt bother swimming everyday, I had booked the hotel specifically to treat the kids to better pool facilities after they had seen the pool area on the website, they had been looking forward to staying there too.STAFF: Always friendly and courteous and very good at saying I am sorry you were misinformed!!

Just got back from a five day stay at Hilton Squaw Peak and found it to be a nice hotel. The suite was a nice change from having just a room, and the extra television set was great for my daughter. The beds were comfortable and had nice linens and a down comforter (although not what you need in Phoenix in August!!) I felt the room was dark and needed some updating. I dont care for sinks outside the bathroom...and you guessed it...here the sink is outside the bathroom! Initially, when we checked in we were given a first floor South suite location. This room was not to our liking, since it was in a dark part of the building that seemed out of the way! We immediately went back to the desk and they offered us a room on the fourth floor. The room was better...however, the elevator to get to the room had no a.c. and the fan did not work!! We realized this was a problem after we had already unpacked! So for five days, my daughter and I ran up and down the stairs to get to the room while my husband decided to tuff it out in the elevator! (Note: I told my husband we should complain about the elevator, but he insisted that this is probably something they are well aware of! To be continued...at end of review) They appeared to be doing lots of updating around the premises (but not to the elevator!) The pool area for the South building was closed due to renovations, however, during our stay, we never witnessed any renovation work going on there! The water park area was nice, and since we were there midweek, there were no crowds to contend with! The lazy river was soooo lazy that sometimes, we actually paddled our way through it! High marks for the cleanliness of the pool area (especially the bathrooms..kept nice and clean!).Ate several times at Hole in the Wall and was very pleased with the food. Had a great waitress the first time we ate there so we were sure to return. This waitress brought to our attention that kids eat free which we were unaware of! Nice bonus! However, upon our return visits, we were charged for our daughters meal and had to remind our servers of this! The service got worse and worse with each return trip and we never saw that first waitress again! We ate at Aunt Chiladas and found it to be an excellent dining experience! (great chips!!)Also had breakfast at 5th and Diner and enjoyed it! Every time we wanted to eat away from the hotel, we needed to drive at least 10-15 mins. to do so. I would have liked a hotel that had places to eat and shop that were a bit closer or walkable. Before I selected this hotel for our stay, I read many reviews and selectedthe Hilton based on the information I gathered. The kid-friendly factor was key to my selection of this hotel and our daughter did enjoy the water park facilities. I would have liked spiffier accommodations for my husband and I to feel a bit pampered, but I guess at the rate we got, it was what we paid for! Back to the elevator story....(I didnt forget!!) when we were checking out, I decided to mention to the desk person that the elevator in our part of the building had no a.c. or fan and that it caused lots of inconvenience for us.

We had a regular suite that was very nice and comfortable. The bed was a little hard but not too bad. The room faced the patio instead of the pool so it was quiet even at night when everyone came back from the water park. The River Park was lots of fun even if you dont have kids. The slide and river float were enjoyable and its a great place for people watching. When it got too crowded for us, we went to one of the smaller pools. Tip: the drinks are $1 cheaper at the bar next to the pool behind the main lobby than they are in the Park. If you just want to sit in the water and have a few drinks, then spend the afternoon there while all of the other guests are in the big pool.The service was outstanding from the room service guy to the pool boys. Everyone was friendly and seemed to really enjoy their jobs. The location was good because it was only a few blocks to Highway 51 (Squaw Peak Express) and you can get to all of the other highways quickly from it. The baseball park was only 15 minutes away and the Improv nightclub in Tempe was only 20 minutes (we did not travel during rush hour). I shopped around heavily for rates and as usual, the Hilton web site had the best rates and packages. We will definitely return next summer.

We stayed at this hotel for 6 days and did not want to leave. We had a very relaxing time and enjoyed the lazy river, water slide and the dive in movie on Saturday night. Our son is 4 and is just learning to swim. We took off his life vest and he was able to slide down the slide by himself. One of us was waiting to catch him in the 3 foot deep water below. The slide is perfect for smaller children and adults that cant handle huge slides (like my husband!). The drinks by the pool were a little expensive but snacks and beverages were located right by the pool. The restrooms were very clean -even at the end of the day. We ate most days at the Hole in the Wall and never had a bad meal. The chili, ribs, salads and chicken were all very good and the portions were huge. The only bad meal we had was breakfast at the Lantanta grill. The service was terrible. I swear they had one waitress for the whole restruant. We got one cup of coffee and never saw the waitress again. We had to go search for the check and the people sitting next to us finally got their own water because nobody elso was around to do it. We loved our room. It was perfect for us. Our son who wakes up very early was able to go into the other room and watch T.V. while the rest of us slept in the bedroom. We would recommend this hotel to everyone. The only other complaint I have was about the railing outside of our room. There was a huge space on either side of the railing. It didnt look to be damaged-it just had huge gaps. The first thing my son did was to inform us that he could stick his head through the hole. My husband pulled him back in time. I did say something to a security personal -but of coure he told me that a child couldnt fit though the railing. I told him my whole body could fit through the hole when I turned sidways and I weigh 140lbs. I am mentioning this problem because though I loved this hotel, I dont want any child to fall. We really did like this hotel but when you stay there I am sure you will see the gaps in the railing for yourself and if you have small children will understand my being very nervous about this. If more people complain-I hope they will fix it. We are looking forward to staying here again. We also found the hotel personal to be very friendly and helpful. They were so nice in the giftshop. We bought some presents for friends and for our daughter because it was her 1st birthday. We later returned to our room to find a present for her from the staff in the giftshop. It was so unexpected and our daughter loved the bear and so did we!

The positives far outweighed the negatives.Checkin/Checkout - Easy and quick. A bit of pressure from the bellman to have them assist you with your luggage, but the gentlemen who ended up helping us was very nice and helpful.Room - We had a 2 bedroom casita in the back of the resort. The 2 level casita was spacious, clean, comfortable and well-equiped. 3 total TVs, all of good quality and size. High-speed internet is $10/day and worked well. There was a fullsize refrigerator in the casita and a microwave. The casitas are far from new, so there were certainly a reasonable amount of paint cracks, carpet stains, tile disclorations. Nothing that anyplace that age wouldnt have. The air conditioning worked great!Resort - The resort is large and very quiet, considering how many people were there. It is very well kept up, and the views of Squaw Peak are great. The pools did get a bit crowded, but we had no problem finding lounges. Towels were provided at all pool areas. Outside of the main water park, the other pools were quite small, but plentiful. Kids loved the lazy river (its a bit too lazy I think). A negative for me are that there did not seem to be a bar area that was open late. Also, there did not seem to be a game room or some central location for the kids to congregate.Restaurants - I had numerous meals and drinks at the pool bar. Service was friendly and quick and the prices were reasonable for a resort. If you start a tab there check your closeout bill carefully as I was charged for others orders. It was taken care of by the staff without any issue. I had breakfast one day in the Hole In the Wall and it was quite good and reasonably priced.Location - I mentioned the mountain view earlier and that is a big plus. There is a supermarket and Walgreen right down the street which we found handy. Highway 51 (North/South) is also right down the street and was used often. Fairly close to airport. Its ~ 15 minutes to Scottsdale, so if you plan to spend a lot of time there, you may want to consider one of the many resorts there.Overall, a winner.

We got the dining package ($129/night) which includes $50 meal voucher and stayed in the South Tower on the 3rd floor. Pros: The $50 voucher and combined with the kids eat free was great. The family had a great dinner every evening and I paid only about $7-10 bucks out of pocket for tip which fed 5 people. We primarily ate at Hole In The Wall restaurant. The food was good and this restaurant is definitely more geared toward family and kids than Lantana, the other restaurant on the property.The rooms were nice, clean, and quiet. We got a 2 double-bed suite. Air-conditioning worked fine even in the hot August days.The kids had a great time at the River Ranch as well as the pool in the South Tower. Two TVs allowed the two boys to watch their programs and not fight. Laundry facilities on 4th floor was easy to use.Cleaning staff was very helpful. We requested a mini frig and microwave for our rooms and they brought them up (subject to availability). The room includes a mini-bar fridge, but this is stocked with overpriced hotel goodies. Having our own fridge allowed us to stock up on munchies from a grocery store down the street (Bashas) and the kids munched away for much cheaper.Cons: $10/day charge for Internet access. Most hotels that I stayed at included this for free. $10/dy charge to use the gym. This is part of a value package that includes other things (e.g. minature golf on-site, we didnt try this).

Booked directly through their website  selected a Bounceback Vacation at $99 nightly which included breakfast for two adults. We were advised during a quick, pleasant and straightforward check-in that kids eat free on this deal - this was not advertised so came as a very welcome surprise. Optional $9 daily resort passes were explained to us but we were not pressured to buy them. [In fact these seemed to represent very good value when shared by a family who would use the additional facilities]. On booking I had requested only that our room be not too far from pools. We were allocated a remodelled room top floor North Tower: Yes our balcony overlooked the inescapable car park but directly beyond that only mountains with fantastic view of sunrise [which with jet lag we were able to fully appreciate each morning!].... and excepting the Casitas it was as close as could be to the River Ranch pools.The Hotel and Grounds were attractively landscaped and commendably vigilently maintained. Our suite itself was immaculate - spacious, comfortably but not overfussily furbished, well laid out  generous storage. The bathroom  dressing areas  fittings superb. Wonderfully comfortable Beds and especially the plumpest ever pillows get a special thumbs up.The River Ranch was great for families with younger kids - nothing too hardcore for thrill seeking teenagers mind. One decent Water Slide, [very] lazy river, waterfalls, sporty pools set up for volleyball, basketball etc, kids pools - you name it. It was at all times generously staffed and very well maintained. I was particularly impressed with Poolside RestRooms - which cant be easy to keep spotless all day long but they managed. Refrigerated drinking water was freely available throughout the resort. Pool water was probably more heavily chlorinated than your skin appreciates but certainly not more so than other hotel pools. River Ranch opening hours were from 8.30am to 8.30pm but the good-sized and [while we were there] tranquil courtyard pools and hot tubs are open from 5.30am until... 11pm, I think - so if you are noise sensitive you might not appreciate being allocated a ground floor room in this area. The Kids Koyote Club was way out of our budget to send the Kids just for the fun of it if you were remaining on-site [about $60 per child per day session I think?] but no dobt a valuable service for those here on a conference or needing some time out. They also offered a great $5 midday movie  popcorn to entice the kids out of the midday sun. We ate three times at the Hole in the Wall Restaurant: Two breaksfasts and one dinner. Service and food both consistently exceptional - very child friendly indeed. The lovely location of the terrace overlooking the River Ranch is the icing on the cake. Lest this review read like I am a share-holder [although after this experience I might just consider?] let me say that our only negative experience was a breakfast at the Lantana Grill [this place seems more oriented to Squaw Peaks other key market - Conference - than family market]. On our visit here customers seemed to be outnumbered by staff about 3 to one yet it took 20 minutes to have our order taken and another 30 for our breakfasts to arrive - when it did the orders were wrong but we were running so late by then I confess we let it go. Lantana Grill menu prices seemed comparable to Hole in the Wall but neither portions nor quality of food was close. The staff stood around in large groups talking and ignoring us. When I visited the restroom it clearly hadnt been checked for hours as the bins were flowing over and the wet floor strewn with wet towels .. and crawling along the foor I saw the only cockroach I spotted in the entire resort grounds.We also dined at the adjacent Aunt Chiladas Mexican which has been enthusiastically reviewed on this site. I confess I was very disappointed with the food which appeared at our table in the blink of an eye after our orders were taken ........ and was bland and overcooked. However I do have to admit their complimentary chips  dips are as good as any I ever tasted and the ambience was great!  We were fortunate to visit midweek when the resort was lively enough to be buzzing but not in any way crowded. As we were leaving [start of July 4 holiday weekend] the hotel was clearly heavily booked and getting hectic - possibly I may not have enjoyed that weekend quite so much. Nor would it be my first choice for a romantic weekend away from the kids. I have no doubt that there are more exclusive resorts in Phoenix - with plusher pool towels, but in this price range? - at $99 daily with a delicious  generous breakfast for four, lovely environment to relax in, all day entertainment poolside without having to fork out an extra penny ... and the best nights sleep away from home - why it quite distracted me from lamenting the heat!If I were management at the Hilton Squaw Peak I would be extremely proud of my staff who succeed in keeping the place so pristine and providing a genuine welcome for families.

Over 20 of us were in Phoenix from the UK for a wedding. Everyone was blown away with the resorts facilities for a pretty good price. It was great having the extra room in the one-bedroom suites. The casitas were great as well but not sure if they were worth the extra money although they were in a great setting. The water park was fantastic for kids and we could have done with longer there. Restaurants were good although the service in the Laguna Grill was pretty slow - fine if youre not in a hurry. We were woken up one morning at 4am by maintenance as a faulty toilet had flooded our apartment and was starting to flood downstairs. We did feel that the hotel could at least have offered us a free breakfast for the inconvenience of waking our family up in the middle of the night while they mopped up for 1.5 hours!

The first room we were given was a handicapped room (were not handicapped but the room was very spacious!!!), and it had no seal on part of the door, so bugs could come right in, you could see a lot of light on the bottom of the door. I notified the front desk and requested a new room. We were moved to a different room, but realized it had the same problem. I didnt want to be a bother and request a third room, so we stayed. Also, the ceiling on the patio appeared to be moldy, it had black splotches all over it. Someone from housekeeping came in our room without knocking right after we got settled in and were getting ready to go swimming. My daughter was completely naked putting on sunscreen in the front room (had a room with a front room near the main door and a bedroom). This lady just stood there with the door wide open trying to hold a conversation with me while my child was standing there naked. She didnt leave until I told her to Get Out!! That was the worst experience for my daughter. She was so embarrassed! The bathroom sink was nearly impossible to turn off and it dripped constantly if you didnt use all of your strength to turn it off. Then our dinner at Hole In The Wall was so burned, it was not edible. Not to mention I asked for no onions and no peppers, I got both, but I didnt get the tomatoes that were supposed to come with it. The manager was great about that, he didnt charge us for the meal and gave us dessert for free too. That was nice and our other meals there were fine. I had a magnetic Organ Donor ribbon stolen off my car while we were there. Room service took about an hour to deliver and the quality of food was poor. The salad actually made me sick. They also had some sort of sports teams there and the kids were running all over the hotel very late. They were knocking on doors and being very loud. I called the front desk and they said they would put a stop to it. They didnt. The final straw for me was the salon. I went to Toca Sierra Salon for highlights. The next day, it was not even noticeable that I had it done. They used too dark of a color, so I spent another hour there getting it re-done. Including tip, I spent $100, and it wasnt a good job. Its so far from the roots, it looks like I need to have it re-done already, and I do. After returning home, I contacted the salon manager. She was awesome about the whole situation and is refunding me all of what I spent and sending a certificate for a free massage. I have yet to hear back from the hotel manager in order to get the hotel-related matters resolved, but at least the salon was quick to respond and was very helpful in the situation I encountered. I guess if you do choose this hotel, make sure your doors are locked at all times and check the room they give you top to bottom before you unpack and ask for a different room if you see a problem. Dont be afraid to speak up, it helps the hotel to address issues for future guests comfort too! Hope this helps you.

We arranged with a girl at the desk to provide a room key to our son who was arriving later in the day, and for whom wed reserved an extra room. She smilingly assured us all would be taken care of. When we returned late in the afternoon, we discovered by phone that our sons room still was not ready and that he hadnt checked in. We suspected something amiss and so waited in line to talk with the smiling girl whod promised everything would go so smoothly. She avoided talking to us - before our turn arrived, she signalled to a male desk clerk to take care of us, though at that point wed given no signs of being upset. We simply wanted to know if our son had arrived. She obviously knew things had not proceeded according to plan and was afraid to face us.We were directed - rather escorted - to speak to a male desk clerk who was already bristling, though nothing had yet been said. My wife asked if our son had arrived and was told yes. Was he given a key to our room? No, because he hadnt a picture ID! But he has his passport - he just flew in from Montreal, my wife said. Lower your voice when youre speaking to me! the man replied, though I didnt note anything extraordinary in her tone. His escapist reply might have been comical, were it not so rude. But we arranged for him to be given a key... my wife continued, nearly whispering, and glancing to her side at the (formerly) smiling girl who was now leaving the reception area to escape any possibility of becoming involved.I was wondering what the man would say in regard to the passport - obviously our son could not fly in without an adequate picture ID. Dont point your hand at me! the man instead replied, though all my wife was doing was resting her right hand (she was holding our car keys) on the countertop, while her left hand was still holding her purse.That desk clerk could be termed a cretin, a loose cannon, an untrained or idiot Faulty Towers like clerk - whatever - but I have little inclination to ever return to that hotel just because of him and the smiling girl who apparently feared involvement because her colleague had probably intervened and refused my son a key.The Pointes grounds at Squaw Peak are extensive. We searched for our son for nearly an hour before we found him - our paths between the Hole in the Wall and Dantano restaurants and the pool, convention center and room nearly crossed several times, till finally we called for the Nth time on one of the hotel phones and received word hed checked in What a joke! It was after 4:00 p.m. We also received a message on our room phone to that effect.The following day, the idiot clerk graced with us a perky good morning, etc., while the smiling girl avoided looking. I felt a strong inclination to answer his good morning with Dont raise your voice at me!, but why escalate things with a moron.Theyve got a great water park - and maybe it justifies dealing with idiots. Ill leave that matter to other guests to balance out.

We had a beautiful room in the South building with a wonderful balcony that faced the Phoenix mountains. What a sight every morning as the sun came over the top of those mountains! The restaurants on site were a little pricey, but not any more than any other eatery in the area. The food was very good and at times it was nice not to have to get in the car to go anywhere to eat, you just had to walk over and order what you wanted. It was the most relaxing vacation weve had in a long time and we will go back without a doubt.

The Cicada was very out-dated and in needof a few upgrades, particularly the carpet. They spared no expense onthe beds. The beds were very comfortable with down blankets andpillows. My 9 year old daughter said that this wouldnt be a 3 starhotel if it wasnt for the beds.The Hole in the Wall restaurant was good food and average service. Thefirst couple of meals were fine but one morning for breakfast we waitedover 40 mins. And never saw our food or water again. We had to trackhim down in order to get our bill because my wife had meetings toattend. They did box up my food to take with me at no charge. Theyinformed us that they were very busy that morning and apologized. The service by the pool was horrendous. There were very few people totake care of a very large area. We had an average wait time of about ahalf hour for a drink. At one point a server had noticed that a halfdozen flags on our lounge chairs were up and he told us that our serverwas busy and he walked off and sat down next to a girl sun bathing andcontinued to talk to her while we waited. When our guy did show upthere were so many orders to take it was another 20 mins before wereceived our drinks. Oh, and he forgot my two daughters drinks...After that I decided to just go to the bar (Slim Pickens) myself. Onlyproblem here is there isnt enough staff to service all of the serversand people at the bar and people that cant get served. While my wifewas in meetings we were at the pool and the service continued like thisfor three days until my very hungry wife (day 3) who was never servedbreakfast met us by the pool for lunch. We figured a hotdog lunch anddrinks but we only saw one server and because of this the line at thebar was about a 30 min wait. My wife had called to let the manager knowthat the pool was way under staffed and that if we cant get served andcant bring anything into the pool area, how were we going to eat? The manager sent us the director of the Slim Pickens and Hole in theWall. This guy was very nice and apologetic and offered to get us aseat at the Hole in the Wall but we informed him that there was a chancewe would get served because or our earlier experience at breakfast.This man not only personally served us lunch by the pool but hecompletely fixed the pool services problem. Six people showed up andall the lines went away. Servers were walking around asking if youwanted anything because everyone was taken care of. He also to oursurprise took care of our dinner bill that night.We also ate at the Aunt Chiladas restaurant. Very good food and itcould have been a coincident but we had an ok service the first night sowe went back the next night and in took about two hours from time we satdown to the time we got our bill.

Great kids concierge area with plenty of free games to check out.Cons: We had breakfast everyday in the restaurants, mainly because I had vouchers. Terrible service. Yes it was crowded but they are still severely understaffed. Also breakfast was expensive ($12-$15 for a so-so buffett that didnt include coffee or juice). The last 2 days we just went with the buffett anyway because the wait to order and get your food was so long. The rooms, though large and fine for us, are definitely dated.

We were offered bellhop service but chose to find our room ourselves. We had requested that we be away from the 24 hour pools (less noisy) and on the top floor if possible. Both our requests were met. Our room was clean, spacious and even had a microwave! Our view was of the parking lot but was partially screened by a huge palm tree growing right outside our window. We were at the very end of the row of rooms closest to the side entrance into the complex.-good because there werent people walking back and forth in front of our room... bad because the view wasnt great from either window! (Also the garbage truck came in the side entrance and you might be disturbed by the noise)We bought the BounceBack package which gave us food vouchers for breakfast every day at either of the two restaraunts on the property. A very good deal (We loved both of them) .Lantana had great Mexican shredded beef! Hole in the Wall was more fun being right outside by the pool. Suggestion to those who have read this far... get there early cause it fills up fast. We never ate the buffet because there were so many other tasty things on the menu. As for lunch, we broke the bank and ordered poolside, heh you only live once! The quesadillas were quite good!Dinner we went off property. Aunt Chilladas across the street was very good. Large servings of Mexican and reasonably priced. It is a hike from the far side of the property, so have the bellman drive you over in his cart! We went way out of town to a place that had sawdust on the floor and neckties hanging from the ceiling (this place was in one of our guide books, maybe Frommers) and it was a waste of money. Sorry I cant recall the name! The pool... lots of fun, even for my 12 and 13 year old boys. They enjoyed floating very slowly (it was very crowded and bottle necks occurred lots) down the lazy river and they also had fun in the larger pool as well. Another hint for those who are still reading... the lounge chairs can be very hard to get especially under an umbrella. Make sure to get up early and get down to the pool so that you can get a chair. I mean stand in line at the pool entrance before it opens , lots of others will be there already, I promise you!!! (Warning -Dont try to save a chair by sneaking in early thru the tennis courts - there are empoyees who watch for this tactic and will take your stuff away or send you back out on your way!!!

The waterpark was busy on the Sun, but very quiet on the Mon  Tue.The Lantana restaurant was the best place for food, though the Hole in the Wall was good for breakfast.Our only real complaint was that the kids club was closed, as they apparently require 3 or more kids to open it. I guess this was because it was the start of the low season - it was still a disappointment as the hotel blurb led us to believe that it was open year round.If you are travelling from the UK, this hotel can be booked very cheaply through Trailfinders (we paid æ‹¢75 inc tax) - better than any other web deals.

Mistake, major mistake!!!Lets start at the check-in. Well, I couldnt even park my car in that area, because too many parked cars where directly standing in the driveway. So I got on the parking lot next to the Travelodge.When I saw trash like ripped out carpet in the parking lot, I thought okay, not the best neighborhood, seems to be the place where some weirdos drop their trash. Then I walked over the grass wondering about beer bottles and stuff I didnt even want to see laying around on the grass in front of the Travelodge. I went up to the check in expecting a huge crowd because of the many parked cars. But nobody was in the lobby with the exception of the check-in person, who was doing the job of checking me in. Well, that was pretty unenventful and I asked where the parking lot for the Travelodge might be. Turned out I already parked my car on the trashed motel parking lot.I got to my room 105 the jacuzzi suite. If you are looking for a very scary place to spend Halloween, that 105 is your room.Non-smoking room smelling like an ashtray.Wall paper missing on the wall. Electrical wires just laying around cut off. I have not figured where they belonged to.A bathtub I wouldnt even give my dog a bath in and she is really not picky.A ironing board without the iron. I guess that makes it a surf board for the poor.Electrical wires got fixed with some tape instead of getting really fixed. If I would have had my kids with me, I would have left right away.No remote control for tv - well I grew up when the first generation of remote controls were invented. Maybe that news of the invention didnt get through to the Travelodge. Minor inconvenience.No internet access - one reason why I picked that place.Major problem for me. Since I run an internet business.While looking for a phone to check with front desk what might be the problem, I discovered they dont even put a phone in the room. So I grabbed the motel information in hope I find some magic information for the internet connection. Big mistake, with the exception of strip joint information most of the pages got ripped out in part.Next morning I wanted to take a shower. Being a bit on the taller side, I figured out that most motel showers got designed for short people. But when I got into the shower - good thing I wear glasses, but not under the shower, otherwise I would have need a couple of beers to get in there - and turned on the water, I was waiting for a splashing noise. Instead I hear a stronger dripping noise. Yes, the shower was turned on all the way, but there was no pressure. A light rain in Phoenix has more power than that shower.Finally I only wanted to check out. Once I got to the front desk the guy working there was busy doing something (lets say freecell or solitaire) on the computer. He only looked at me with the expression of What do you want!?!I nicely told him that I would like to check out, put down the keys and asked for the name of the manager.What do you want?Can you please write me down the full name of the manager?Chad!Can you please write the full name down?Chad the manager.His name is Chad the manager? Very unusual name. What is his real full name?Chad Hill.Can you please write it down for me?Totally annoyed by getting asked to write down the name of the manager, he grabbed a piece of paper and wrote down the name.I thanked him and left knowing, I will never ever stay there.I travelled the globe, never wrote a complaint before, because usually you can arrange somehow, but this time it was too much of reason to stay calm.To make a long story short: AVOID THIS PLACE.

I then was given a deluxe room. Better than the first in that it didnt have broken windows, etc. When I went to sleep that night there was no blanket on the bed and when I called the desk I was told we dont put blankets on every bed. I was also given only one towel (no wash cloths, hand towels, etc.) and was told we are full and dont give everyone towels. The bed also kept falling out of the frame.

I was told they would fax the property and attempt a resolution. That night at about 3:00 am while sleeping in the bedroom area I was awoken by the sound of the front door closing. I ran out and saw my laptop computer and some cash were missing (I had set the deadbolt and put the chain on). The chain was torn away from the frame. I called the front desk and was told I was the only one with the key and what did I want them to do about it. I said to call the police. The officer determined that there was no forcible entry and that someone with a key card had entered the room. The police were not able to get in contact with the manager.

(I come to the PHX area every March for Spring Training Baseball) Now, it is a rat hole. Other reviews have described the awful conditions. I endured all-night parties, with an overnight hotel agent who was either too sleepy or indifferent to my noise complaints. (I checked out the following morning)All of the descriptions you can read in other reviews are absolutely true -- I was shocked at the condition of the hotel, upon my return. I can only assume not one dime has been invested in the property for maintence and upkeep. I also was sickened by the hotel jacuzzi. I developed a skin rash 2 days later. I lodged a complaint with the AZ Dept Of Health Services. (Unfortunately, as I checked out --I told the clerk that the jacuzzi wasnt hot enough -- that probably reminded management that they hadnt cleand the tub in weeks) Of course, by the time the AZDH inspected, they were given a clean bill of health. If you want to search, you can probably find the complaint on file, if you do not want to take me at face value.When I praised that hotel earlier, I meant what I said. At that time, the property was a great value for the price. I now completely have an opposite view. I did contact Travelodge, and they never returned E-mails. Its obvious why this chain is slowly vanishing, as I note their hotel guide gets smaller every years. Customer service? Sorry, not with Travelodge.I would only hope this lodge is deleted from the Travelodge chain. Also, this hotel is a sister to another Travelodge in Mesa, on the east side of town. I did stay there once, but that was over 8 years ago. I remember the A/C broke there the night I stayed, and temps that March were soaring to 90 degrees. Avoid both of these facilities. At least the property in East Mesa doesnt have prostitutes soliciting you.By the way I would not at all describe the neighborhood as a crime zone. I believe the only such zone in the neighborhood is the hotel, itself. But, yes, the area seems to be zoned for -- barnyard animals as pets.

First the cons:The rooms are small, for me this was cozy and nice since I was staying alone. It wouldve been tougher to share the room with anyone but a spouse/close family member. It is also on a noisy street (even the sides that dont face Lombard are noisy), but I borrowed a fan from the management and had no problems with that. There are a few small items in need of repair (a loose tile in the bathroom, etc.). There is some fuss made about the smell in other reviews. Honestly, to me it didnt smell bad - it just smells like an older building, like my grandmothers house which had radiators just like the Edward II. Really, not a problem except for those who would wear Lysol as cologne.The pros: It is charming. The breakfast room has plenty to eat - oatmeal, fresh fruit, juice, breads, several cereals, pasty, quiche, GOOD coffee and a very extensive selection of loose teas with little teapots for steeping. It was clean and the beds and pillows were comfortable. The innkeepers were very helpful - answered every question and accommodated every request.

But the door was heavy and the sounds from the adjoining room were not an issue. Door was a bit hard to open, but locked securely. The decor was Asian theme oriented with a nice black lacquer Chinese style headboard on the bed and a pretty painted screen. The rest of the furniture was quite dated, and frankly needed updating. The electric fireplace was completely worthless as it produced no heat and was faced in such a way that you couldnt see the fake flames from the bed or the couch! The TV was a whopping12 screen, but it had clear reception and a DVD player. The bathroom was clean and spacious. There were plenty of towels, none of which were super plush, but all smelled, looked and felt clean. There was a blow dryer. There was no shower enclosure, which was a bit odd, but as I said there were lots of towels, so we could clean up the over spray. The other odd thing about the bathroom was the door to the toilet/shower/sink---if you are looking for privacy, forget it! The bathroom door has a large glass window in it. There was a cold mini fridge (I have paid twice as much for rooms in hotels that had warm fridges!). A small wet bar type sink and closet complete the room. The ceilings are high and the lighting was period in appearance. This is in an old building--so it is NOT ADA compliant. Overall the room was fine--it was clean and the theme provided charm to an otherwise outdated interior.The room did have windows that were frosted, so you couldnt see out. There was minimal alley type noise and you could hear dishes clanking from the restaurant next door. All was quiet at about 10 pm. The next noise we heard was around 7:30AM when the garbage truck came. Hey, its a crowded city and you are staying in an old building--I am not expecting it to be absolutely quiet. There are many wonderful places to eat, wine bars, coffee spots, and shops on Chestnut--one street over from Lombard.The Breakfast:This was also quite nice for the price we were paying. There was hot, fresh homemade quiche, yogurt, two types of cereal, store bought Danish pastry, several types of breads, and a fruit plate. There was milk, water, tea, coffee, hot cocoa and orange juice. The dishes were clean and Jai kept bringing out more piping hot quiche. Newspapers and access to the internet were waiting for us in the morning. They told us when we were leaving that they dont open their pub much to the public, but if you want a drink in the evening, the staff will be happy to serve you. I wish they would have told us that the night we checked in!I have no idea what the European shared bathroom rooms were like--but I think everyone was satisfied with the bed and breakfast rooms. Staff guided us to good food and public transportation options. I think that the accommodations are fine, but certainly not luxurious. I would stay here again.NOTE: Take bus 30 from Powell BART Station--do not attempt to walk from the end of the trolley car line, down Lombard to the Inn. That is the mistake we made coming in and boy, that climb up the big hill with our suitcases was grueling. Bus 30 was a lifesaver! Getting from the Oakland Airport to the Marina area was not a problem--take Air Bart Bus to the BART station in Oakland and then head into San Francisco. Save your money and put it towards a good meal. ', 'Nov 17, 2007', '2', '2', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '4', '4', '3'), ('18', 'bella&sweet', 'For people with a very limited budget..... I did not noticed my reservation said shared bathroom. I never have stayed in something like this so since I booked a room with 2 beds I thought it was one bath to be shared for 2 persons....LOL The room is tiny, barely fits 1 queen and 1 junior bed. That is ok for me I know land is expensive. Breakfast was good, better than in la quinta because of the hot quiche and cake. Also bananas, milk, coffee, tea, yogurt, cereal that is it.Area does not look scary, and I felt safe. Front desk staff is nice. Restaurants around, pharmacies....Bad side: Internet is charged extra. Noisy room faced the street, so I woke up 4 or 5 times during hte night. My friend said it was ok for her. I totally disliked the GREEN MOLD around the sink furniture, yes the sink was in front of my face beside the closet. Room smelled bad I coudl even say to peeing... absolutely disgusting for me. The surprised of what is a shared bathroom (you share bathtub located in one room and a toilette located in another room) is just not for me. One morning while going ot the bathroom I saw a man coming out of the bath room and he did not have towels or the staff you take when you shower then I noted the toilette room was occupied.....I think he pee in the bath tub......I booked this hotel becasue I could not find another and I was going to an interview in a university. Although that I am a student trying to wave some details in order to get student prices .......I would not be back here.....just if I can not find another hotel available....in hte whole SFO ', 'Apr 26, 2007', '1', '1', '2', '2', '1', '3', '1', '4', '3', '1'), ('18', 'VirginiaDreamer', 'Miserable Experience I would not recommend Edward II to anyone except people who put location ahead of everything else. The tiny room was extremely cold, day and night. When I asked how to turn on the heat, I was told that the buildings heat wasnt turned on and there was no way to heat individual rooms. The closet contained only two hangers, and the advertised gourmet breakfast featured an open bowl of some kind of dark brown dry cereal and open plates of bread and pastries, along with an uncovered, gray-looking quiche. The stale coffee was left to boil on hotplates. We chose individual packages of yogurt and fruit, which were good, but not gourmet as promised. The hotel lacks an elevator for taking luggage to the room. Our family will never return to the Edward Ii and will not recommend it to our friends.

First they made us pay up front for the 3 nights (we were planning on staying 3 nights here and 3 nights at the Radisson Miyako for the same price). We climbed up 3 flights of stairs to our TINY room and had a spectacular view of a brick wall and an alley full of trash. The room seriously reminded me of an old maids room with tapestries of teddy bears and wicker furniture. You can hear everyone come in and even though we were in the back I could still hear all the traffic. It was spotless though no complaints in that department. The staff is pleasant but we decided to stay one night only since we were tired. We did get a refund on 2 nights but they did not refund the 2 nights of parking we had paid in advance. Oh yeah, the parking lot is far and pretty scary. The continental breakfast was above your usual fare. Okay I guess, but dont stay here for your honeymoon.

As a result we had to either eat in the pub or bring a tray back to our room. Also, the breakfast itself was only continental, as opposed to a fully-prepared meal, which I gather is the concept of a Bn B.
